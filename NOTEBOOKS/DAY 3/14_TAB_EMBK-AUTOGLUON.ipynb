    "\n",
    "[AutoGluon](https://autogluon.mxnet.io/tutorials/tabular_prediction/index.html) implements many of the best practices that we have discussed in this class, and more!  In particular, it sets itself apart from other AutoML solutions by having excellent automated feature engineering that can handle text data and missing values without any hand-coded solutions (See their [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06505) for details).  It is too new to be in an existing Sagemaker kernel, so let's install it.\n",

    "In order to work with a single table, we joined the intake and outcome tables using the \"Animal ID\" column and created a single __review.csv__ file. We also didn't consider animals with multiple entries to the facility to keep our dataset simple. If you want to see the original datasets and the merged data with multiple entries, they are available under data/review folder: Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes.csv, Austin_Animal_Center_Outcomes.csv and Austin_Animal_Center_Intakes_Outcomes.csv.\n",
