"I bought this program to track my personal checking account/expenses. What I wanted was Quicken like it use to be around 2003, last time I used it. Then is was easy, intuitive and helpful. However, within a few minutes of loading the program I was nearly brought to tears when I synced with my bank (which as a sidebar, you do not seem to have an option to not sync...they want to get right into your bank account). Quicken does not ask which accounts to sync when it does the set up it just grabs all accounts...so my personal account, my kids accounts, my business account, my business line of credit and savings were all synced. It then happily gave me my net worth based upon all of this. Arrrgg!! How hard would it be to ask which accounts? I then tried to delete the accounts only to get a message that I had to contact my bank to do that...3 people later at the bank, no one had any idea what Quicken meant. At that point I threw in the towel for a few weeks. I am working up the courage to go back in and try to see how I can follow one simple checking account to track expenses and tax receipts.

"I am also a small business owner and once again am frustrated that the upgrade is being forced on us. I have used Qkbks since 1997 because it was a simple reasonably priced program. And through the years, our accounting needs have not changed much.  Intuit claims there are customers out there that have needs that require Intuit to add more and more features to their program and that has costs and blah, blah, blah.  Well then let those customers that need more pay for more advanced versions of a program.  There are still many of us that don't have those advanced needs.  Growth can be a great thing and Intuit absolutely should cater to those needs for those customers.  But they are forgetting about the little guy that would like to continue using their small and simple accounting program - the one that was once good and affordable.

LISTEN TO US INTUIT - YOUR PRODUCT IS NO LONGER AFFORDABLE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES!  Why are you not hearing this??  This economy requires us small businesses to be smart and diligent to be able to survive and we have to do business with the right people and companies in order to be successful.  INTUIT is no longer one of those companies.  Not only has the product and pricing surpassed the reach of the small business, the customer service and support is a true joke.  Wake up and pay attention to your customers and not just the financial statement.  In case you have forgotten, those two things do go hand in hand!!

"I am absolutely furious.  I have been an Intuit and Quicken customer for years, always upgrading year after year, but now Quicken has become a separate company and they are migrating my id to their own system.  FINE, but I can not longer use my software; ALL of my financial information is locked in a file I can not longer open.  I can get NO ONE to answer their phone because of so called high volume, NONE of the work arounds work, NO unlocking emails are showing up. Creating a new account will not work because no emails will come through.  Yes I have checked the spam filter, I even checked my accounts online to see if the emails were held there.  Quicken is simply not sending me codes.  I am ready to spit nails.  If they are going to force a new log in they need to make sure their system works.  IT DOES NOT.  So, if you want to loose access to 15 years of your financial information with absolutely no recourse, go ahead and use quicken.  I will be shopping for a different product immediately.  By the way, in my lifetime I have never ever bothered to post a bad review.  As a business owner myself I try to be patient with companies, but there is no excuse for this level of incompetence.

"I'm always a bit leery of Big Software: packages that try to do too much, install too many components, try to get their hooks set all over your system.  So I was a bit leery installing the newest release of Roxio Easy Media Creator, which has been growing rapidly into bloat-ware in recent releases.  It turned out that Ipleasantly surprised to find it more streamlined, cleaner, and professional-looking than previously.

Although one of the big ""enhancements"" in this release is Vista support, I tested this package on my Windows XP Pro machine, on which I was previously running Roxio Creator 9.  I cleanly removed Creator 9 first since installing on top of an old version is always a bad idea, many software complaints seem to arise from not uninstalling the old software first.  Install was straightforward if a bit slow to run on my Inpiron Dual Core system.

My primary purpose in buying Roxio, like many of you, is to create media.  Burning CDs, DVDs, etc is the core strength of Roxio, and they continue to do this well.  One of my frequent tasks is burning CDs from ISO images.  Roxio did this with literally 4 clicks, nice and easy.

The master control panel has been streamlined and it's now easier to get to all of the functions of the package.

Some of the old bloat is gone (the ""ringtone maker"" is no longer included), although big extraneous components like the PhotoSuite photo editor and audiox mixing tools remain.  Those may be useful to the neophyte, but anybody wanting to really tweak their photos is likely to fire up an Adobe product, or something that came with their camera, or with their computer, or some other full featured package.  Including such superfluous programs in a Media Creator suite (when they are available from so many other sources) seems excessive, but I guess it lets the publisher lengthen the feature list.

Other major enhancements include support for Blu-Ray, HD DVD, and HD video, though I didn't have the equipment to check out that new functionality.

If you don't need the Vista support, or the enhanced DVD support, there's not a burning reason (pun intended!) to upgrade from Roxio Creator Suite 9 to Roxio Creator Suite 10.  But if you're in the market, this is a fine product and does its core media work as advertised.

While I wish it were more streamlined still, the software works well, installs easily, and has become more streamlined than before.  Recommended with a 5 star rating.",A continued evolution of the Roxio suite,False,1192406400,4.0943445622220995,1.0

"After years of happy use of Printshop v. 20 on my Windows XP, I bought a new computer with Windows 7 64 bit.  I lost my old computer & software in a recent flood, so I knew I'd have to upgrade to a newer version of Printshop.  I checked the Microsoft Compatibility guide, and sadly found no current information on the software.  Then recently, the site stated that the older version 23 of Printshop WAS found to be compatible with 7 / 64 bit, so I ordered it from Amazon.

"Thank you for this detailed and personal note (redacted below). I understand your concern. Technical or customer support other than the complaint form was not easily or clearly visible, and once I saw that the product did not work, I just followed up on the email I received from Amazon regarding comments and returns. As for the disc itself, I thought it might be my particular Mac Mini that didn't want to accept the disc. So, I spent a great deal of time and effort trying to figure out a way to have a different disc reader or computer attached to the Mini as a workaround. So, after some sturm und drang, I succeeded in linking my MacBook Pro (a work computer) with my Mini. But the same thing happened with the disc - the computer spit it out after about 1 minute of ""thinking"" about it. It did not recognize or mount the disc - even though I wouldn't have used it on the MacBook Pro, which is already running 10.7.5.

I do not have additional time to spend seeking tech support and will be returning the disc. Here's why: I live in Israel. The disc was shipped to a friend's house in New Jersey and brought here when he came for a business trip. He is now leaving tonight for the USA, and I am going to have him return the disc via the directions Amazon offered (UPS pickup at his house, I believe.)

So, whether I try again with another disc, or take the far more expensive step of purchasing a NEW generation Mini (that's $550 v. $30 for the upgrade, which is probably only a temporary fix, anyway, but still may be worthwhile financially, as a new Mac Mini wasn't necessarily in my budget at this time), I will be returning the current disc and seeking a refund.

Again, thank you for the response. I will consider your request. Please feel free to contact me again or to call if you have additional questions or suggestions.

"I read about Snow Leopard in MacLife magazine. My son later expounded its virtues. The main message I was hearing was that it is a smaller, faster OS due to its being written only for Intel-Macs. So I decided to purchase it and install it on my Mini and see what happens. The first things I noticed is that it boots and shuts down faster. The reviews stated that smaller and faster were the main advantages of this upgrade. But there are certain functions that give improved eye candy in other programs. Right after I installed it I found that my All-in-One printer wouldn't scan anymore. This was resolved when I downloaded the latest drivers from HP. Ditto with a utility or two.

"I used the Windows 8 developer trial on a fresh partition of my hard drive to see what it was like, and here is what I feel that people should know about Windows 8.

To start off, here are the good things:

-Amazingly fast boot time
 On my computer it takes Windows 7 about 45 seconds to launch, Windows 8 took about 15 seconds.
-Windows Live tiles
 This is the main feature that Microsoft is marketing about Windows 8, I will not elaborate too much on this, as I am sure you have an idea what this feature has to offer.
-Access to applications exclusive to Windows 8
 Some applications may be exclusive to Windows 8, so you might not have access to that new app everyone is talking about.

Sadly, that is about it, and though these are three big pluses, there are quite a few big minuses.

-No Start button
 The Windows start button (the one you probably see in the bottom left corner of your screen) no longer exists. Meaning that many of the tools you use to quickly navigate your computer are gone, including the search bar. Looking for that term paper you stored in some random file because you were about to pass out, good luck, you can't simply type in something in the search bar and find it instantly.
-Poor Navigation
 Those people used to the Windows 7 explorer tool (the one with an image of a file for an icon) are going to face a huge change in how you navigate your files. It it much more complex, with similar controls to Office 2010, have fun learning how to use that on top of everything else different about your OS.
-Compatibility
 Of course, as with all new OS's you may face some compatibility issues, though this is expected.

Conclusion:
These are the questions that I would have asked if I were about to buy Windows 8, personally, I would say that the typical user should stay with or upgrade to Windows 7. Really you should try the Windows 8 developer trial to get a feel for it, there are many tutorials on how to set up dual boot computer, so you can try it out and switch back to your current OS without any file loss.",Windows users beware,False,1359158400,1.6094379124341005,0.0

"This is more about Nuance than about Dragon for Mac. Like other reviewers I faced the prospect of a forced ""upgrade"" of Dragon 2.5 when I upgraded my Mac OS version. As it turns out, the previous version of Dragon DOES continue to work, at least up through Mac OS 10.8.4. All you need to do is ignore the warning window you get when you launch the app.

Nuance pretends they're doing us a big favor by offering the upgrade (with claimed ""improvements"") at $99.99 - but that price includes an unwanted ""Family Tree Maker"" app and ALSO requires payment of a $9.95 shipping charge. If you want to download the upgrade and skip the unwanted Family Tree product, which would save Nuance the costs of two physical products and shipping them, it costs MORE.

Nuance plainly has no interest in rational pricing. Inquiries by phone and email get short shrift, with bad phone connections to a clueless ESL ""representative"" unfamiliar with the products. it's hard to understand why anyone would want to do business with such an inconsiderate and unreasonable company. As a practical matter, my experience is that the (free) dictation function in the Mac OS works about as well as Dragon's overpriced Mac product.

Here's something that makes even less sense: the free Dragon application for iPhone allows you to dictate quite adequately and email the end product to yourself at your Mac. I've found the voice navigation, correction and layout controls in the desktop version of Dragon to be hit-and-miss at best, so some cutting and pasting is almost always required anyway.

"I've used Norton Utilities as well as Ontrack's System Suite (and their Fix-It Utilities), and have found Ontrack's product much more reliable and have also got better results from it. One part which I haven't yet installed is the firewall, NetDefense, primarily because I'm happy with ZoneAlarm. I was, however, curious about Ontrack's VirusScanner, as I hadn't read much about it. Turns out it's provided by Trend Micro, makers of PC-Cillin. After trying Mcafee's viruscan and trashing two machines with it, I ran Norton AV 2002 next to Ontrack's Suite, and found that Ontrack recognized two viruses that NAV didn't. I already had these viruses stored away, and while it's not a very extensive test, it gave me confidence in its virus-detecting ability.
RegEdit is one tool in this suite that has proven itself to me over and over again, both on Win2000 and a slower machine using Win98SE. After deleting useless links and such from the registry of an older machine, I got almost twice the speed from it.
Jet Defrag does its job well, much faster than Microsoft's defrag tool, but you'd do well to heed Ontrack's warning to run system/disk check first.
EasyRecovery (lite edition) is one tool that will make you want more; it allows the recovery of up to 50 files in this edition -- The full-blown EasyRecovery Pro goes for around $.... And considering the results I've had, it's worth it. I've recovered files from formatted drives, deleted files, and everything except for full-formatted floppies and ""erased"" files (using a disk-erase utility). This edition saved me from losing valuable work on two Zip disks that were trashed on the network where I was going to school.
Overall, I gave the suite four stars because, like another reviewer, the updating routine is a major pain! On Win2000, it only took one reboot, but on Win98 it took no less than FIVE REBOOTS!

3) Windows 8 removes the ability to burn DVD movie's that YOU CREATE from Movie Maker (which isn't great to begin with, but Win 7 can!)
4) Everything is designed to draw you into the M$ ""Ecosystem"" of applications rather than giving you an easy choice to use other vendor solutions that are superior.

"I have McAfee and Spy Sweeper but recently ran into a problem where a website somehow got into my computer and started sending me messages about my computer being infected with a virus. The message said I should go to a site to get a program to get rid of the virus. Well I clicked on it to see how to get rid of it since it was getting annoying and the next thing I know my desktop has been hijacked. I was then looking at a bright colored screen that was to be frank, quite annoying.

So I went online to figure out how to get rid of the malware that was obviously causing a problem. I downloaded Spyware Doctor and it found 9 threats and over 160 infections. It did not however take out the malware. I had to get spybot (which is free but difficult to remove after you use it - it uninstalls but then you have to go into your hard drive and delete extra files) for that and it worked very well.

So if you are looking for something to get rid of viruses this program will hunt them down better than Spy Sweeper and McAfee. The only thing I did notice about having this program is that my computer started to run much slower than usual. Mostly when I'm going online I have to wait a long time for the pages to load.

As far as the scanning goes: The quick scan is called an Intelli-Scan and then there is the option of also doing a full scan. The full scan can take hours (comparred to Spy Sweeper it takes a bit longer but even a full scan on Spy Sweeper can take four hours), literally. You will want to run it at night while you are sleeping or else you will be waiting for it to finish all day.

So I'd still highly recommend this product if you want to be sure to get rid of all the viruses McAfee and Spy Sweeper don't catch. For me it was well worth the price even though I just unistalled the program. It made my computer run too slowly and that was just too irritating for both me and my husband. It could be that my computer is too old to handle this program - I've had my computer for five years now. So take that into consideration when buying this program.

You can create apps, web server extensions, dlls, ActiveX Objects and ActiveX dlls, Control Panel applets, your own controls and much more. You have tons of components, and you can get more tons of them for free at the web.
The standard version doesn't have database components, so you should get instead the Pro or Enterprise version, although you can import the MSADO library and use it the same way you use it at VB.

The sales person was boasting all of this bull**** about how much better it was than windows 98 and yes I bought his bull**** story and got the computer for 1200 bucks. Ever since then I have always had probelms with it it would freeze up a lot and I would always have to use the control alt delete feature to get it working again and sometimes I would have to shut down the computer manually to get it to work right. One day my printer stopped working and I was on the phone for like an hour with the tech support and couldn't get it to work. Since then I haven't had a printer. And then about a couple of weeks ago I bought an HP psc 2355 printer and it printed and it copied but I couldn't get it to scan!!!!!! And I couldn't get any of the printing software to work!!!!!!!!!!!. I was so frustrated because when I called hp and talked to their tech support I was on the phone for f***ing two hours and still couldn't get it to work even the guy from hp said the operating system sucks. So then I took it back to Wal-mart where I bought it from and got my money back. And then I went to best buy and got me an epson 4600 all in one and the sales guy from epson told me that it would work with my system and the sales guy from best buy told me it would work. And when I got home and tried the printer it would copy but it wouldn't print or scan and if I turned my computer on with my printer on it wouldn't boot up to the desktop I kept getting all of these error messages. I couldn't call tech support because it wasn't toll free so I tried reinstalling the stystem and reinstalling the software but it was doing the same thing and even worse to where the computer wouldn't boot up at all the computer wouldn't shut down at all with out turning off the surge protecter so as frustrated as I was I went back down to best buy and got a refund for my printer and talked to somebody from the geek squad and they asked them to diagnose my system for probelems. The guy said well....it would cost sixty bucks but he said honestly it would be a waste of time he told me that I should put that sixty bucks toward an upgrade to windows xp so I took his advice and I did, but I had to pay one hundred bucks for the software and sixty for the installation but it was worth it my computer is running better than ever before, even though I haven't bought another printer yet, the tech guy said it would work for sure.

"NOTE: I paid $70 on 12/03/15.  On 01/02/16, price dropped to $55.  Lesson, WAIT until January as the earliest you can file is 01/07 of the year which is not possible for most people as W-2, 1099 and other forms aren't available until mid-Jan & end of Feb.

I've been using this product since 1988 (DOS, 5.25"" floppies), and wouldn't want to give it up.  Overall, it is very good software with an intuitive interface, but you need to do manual traces or manually validate certain things  --  since you're buying the ""Premiere"" version, your financial situation has more complexity or special situations than the typical taxpayer.

Right now, what you get is a TurboTax ""shell"" to transfer last year's ""info data"" to the current year, plus forms which act as placeholders until finalized forms are released by the IRS. State forms are preliminary and incomplete, and they are last to be released by TurboTax, because typically, State tax codes are based off of what the Feds do.  Also, at this time, W-2's, 1099's, 1098's, etc. haven't been released, and although you can backfill them from all your 12/31/2015 statements, don't bother; WAIT until your IRS report forms are received, then do an online software update.

TurboTax evolved to a Q&A type format which remains the user interface for the past decade or so, grouping similar topics together like ""Income"", ""Deductions"", ""Taxes Paid"", etc. I think it reflects how many taxpayers think about the topics.

Previously, users have complained about the cost of State efile, and pricing structure. I haven't studied the 2015 structure, but here are the usual suspects:

(1) State efile fee of $20 -- I just print/mail-in paper and avoid the fee (many States take 3-4 weeks to process refund; when I lived in NY 15 years ago, it took 8-10 weeks). Not really Turbotax's issue as States should get together and perhaps adopt a common platform which Turbotax & HR Block can just charge a nominal fee for any state rather than the (2014) $20 to file.

(2) My complaint is the TT ""up sell"" to this 'Premier"" version to do stock/securities sales -- previously, it seems ""Deluxe"" was adequate for typical mutual fund or occasional broker transactions, but the TurboTax's ""guide"" pointed me to the ""Premier"" edition to do something that is common to many households -- kind of like paying for ""premium"" airfare ticket to use the toilet (not everyone will use the on-board toilet, but come on, don't price it to be an extra).

According to TurboTax, each version (at the ""Deluxe"" and better) has all the forms; each version vary by the ""Help"" & ""Q&A""; thus, if you feel comfortable or have a repeating return, downgrade to the less expensive Deluxe.  (If you wait to Jan., you may get a step discount anyway).

Admittedly, while there appears to be rising SRP, the actual selling price seems to be just inflation indexed, rather than real increases (unlike my cable & cell phone bills) -- I'm skeptical about the ""more features for the same money"" explanation.  As of today, TurbTax's website selling price is $20 higher than Amazon's and Costco's.  (If you wait to early 2106, it is likely Costco will have a $10-$20 instant rebate).

(3) Historically, price for the 2nd State was somewhat exorbitant (is it still $40 ? used to be $20) - - I needed it for several years because of relocations and cross-state situations (NY-NJ-CT is common, maybe DC-MD-VA and KY-OH. TurboTax says it's competitive, I say it's the last gas station for 100 miles so you have to buy it at whatever they charge.

In the past, I have had several issues with TurboTax, but because I won't encounter them for 2015, it is hard for me to determine if they still persist, or if TurboTax has solved them.

(1) Previously, the NY State software would default to Itemized Deduction when I Itemized for Fed filing -- in NY, often STANDARD Deduction is better than adjusted Itemized Deduction (State taxes are not deductible for State returns, and for many renters, Standard would be better). The NY State software was too dumb to do a comparison between the two. I had to do an override for several years but now don't live in NY anymore (NOTE: your state may require the same deduction election as chosen for Fed return).

Lesson: if you Itemized for Fed, manually compare your State's adjusted Itemized to Standard.

(2) I now file Form SE, and the first time using it, it would populate numbers that were VERY difficult to determine the source. It required a lot of cross checking to determine where the numbers were coming from. It seems the W-2 Follow-on Interface now has a specific question on employment by International Organizations which don't have payroll withholding.  Form SE has been working well for me for the past 3 years.

Lesson: check that earned income is aggregated and limited to 2015 FICA $118,500)

(3) For California (during 2003-09), TurboTax would NOT apply capital loss carry-forward to State taxes, and I paid State taxes on capital gains w/o offset from carryover capital losses. I overpaid several hundred $ of Calif taxes, and when I became aware, was able to file an amended return (see below). (Odd since Intuit's HQ is in Mountain View, Calif.)

Lesson: check that carry-forwards (of ANY kind, like capital loss) are also carried to appropriate State schedules, even if you confirmed it was carried to the Fed return from the previous year).

In the 2015 version, I will test Virginia carry-forward for 529 College contributions --  VA permits maximum deduction of $4,000 to its State 529 program, and carry-forward if contributions exceed annual limit (I vaguely remember in 2014 it did correctly carry forward, but I'll check.)  UPDATE: Beginning 2015 (this version), it asks YOU to input carry-forward from previous years; have to wait if it tracks & auto carry-forward to 2016 & future.

(4) Compared to versions from years ago, the software has much less ""data source"" documentation. In older versions, you could click on a field and it would send you to the field, form or info page where the data / number was transferred from. Now, you get a vague entry or help window that doesn't help to quality-assure the various numbers.

TT's ""community Q&A"" is a brilliant use of ""free"" social media --  if the software's built-in Help text doesn't help, post your question and maybe a friendly & knowledgeable person will answer.  For any ""free"" advice by non-credentialed people on the Net, trust BUT VERIFY.

The Amend Return function for States is now much easier -- I needed to use it for 3 consecutive years in arrears because of Turbotax software bugs. Beginning around 2008, the software was able to provide (for states) a function that allowed more automation to the process.

For those with mutual funds with pass through paid foreign taxes, TT makes completing the associated form easy to get the tax credit.

TurboTax in TY2014 made FATCA (foreign assets disclosure) and Affordable Health Care questions very easy to complete.  Wealthy tax filers are likely angry about FATCA but appreciate TT's ease of complying with the law.","A Cost of Funding Our Federal, State and Local Governments",True,1449100800,4.219507705176107,1.0

"There are a lot of DV editing programs out there. Some are easy to use, some are powerful, few are both. I have used Sony's Vegas software and experimented with a Premiere Pro trial, Magix, and Avid Free DV, but was very pleasantly surprised by this software. Although Vegas is easy to use, my experience was that a lot of the features are glitz and lack substance. Magix was a great editor for newbies, but was far too limited for any serious projects. Even though Avid is difficult to learn, it's a proven product. The only reason I didn't buy it was because their HDV products cost a fortune. Just can't afford them.

Canopus has been around for a while, and is famous for their acceleration hardware and quality codecs and conversion software. I had no idea how this product would behave, but with HDV editing at this price, I knew I wanted to give it a shot.

My experience was mostly very positive. Great results, minimal fuss, and powerful features. I was able to capture 16:9 HDV footage and generate an anamorphic DVD from it. It never crashed, and it did everything I wanted it to. Why not 5 stars? The documentation really could be better. The learning curve could be a bit less steep.

I run System Mechanic version 10.1.1 on 3 HP laptop machines using XP (2gig RAM, 150GB HD) and Vista (3GB RAM, dual drives of 250GB and 100GB HD)in 32bit and Win7 (4GB RAM, 320GB HD) in 64bit versions.  After reading the negative reviews I was prompted to add my opinions and observations.  My XP was old and so cluttered it had become practically useless.  My XP has at least another year of life due to the decrease in boot time and file retrieval.  Not theoretical platitudes...real world and very noticeable observation.  My Vista and Win 7 machines were already quick and are quicker now after installing System Mechanic 10.1.1.  You see, in addition to fixing and compacting the registry, it also has a new defrag feature of the HD that helps files load in an order faster than a simple defrag will do.  Yes, I have tried various other registry ""fix"" programs and all seem to help somewhat but never fix all issues.  Likewise, System Mechanic won't fix everything and some here have claimed that it even damages their registry--I can't speak to that, I'm sure they believe their claims but that has not been my experience using System Mechanic for over 1 year on various computers.  As for customer support ... I've found that excellent customer support indicates the company has a tremendous amount of experience with dissatsifed customers.  I don't want there to be a NEED...since need indicates that the software, hardware and/or operator was faulty.  I have NOT found System Mechanic to damage anything and, in fact, it seems to do repairs better than the competitors I've tried.

I'm not an IT professional or a computer geek...I'm like most of you.  Money spent on a program should deliver what it promises with minimal effort and, for me, this product has delivered.",System Mechanic 10,False,1294617600,1.6094379124341005,1.0

"WordPerect X5 is an office suite consisting of WordPerfect X5 (Word Processor), Quattro Pro X5 (Spreadsheet), Presentations X5 (Mutimedia Presentation), and WordPerfect Lightning  (Digital Notebook).

This review will highlight some of the features of the WordPerfect Office Suite.

WordPerfect
-----------
- QuickCorrect
QuickCorrect (called AutoCorrect in Word) is a pretty standard feature in word processors nowadays but a feature unique to WordPerfect is SpeedLinks. SpeedLinks allows you to specify a ""Link Word"" (e.g. @Amazon) and a corresponding Web address to link to (e.g. Amazon's Web address). Every time you type in @Amazon, the ""@Amazon"" will be replaced with Amazon's Web address.

- Multiple File Formats Supported
You can convert a WordPerfect file into Microsoft Word and other word processor formats such as WordStar, XyWrite, and DisplayWrite. If your document contains tables, you have to the option of converting the document into MS Excel, OfficeWriter, QuattroPro, and Lotus 123 as well.

- Frustration-Free
I used Word for many years before I gave up on it almost entirely. I usually elect instead to create my documents in a plain text editor like Editplus, copy and paste it in Word, and ten add on the finishing touches, such as underlining, italics, and bold (which a plain text editor cannot do). The reason: formatting quirks (e.g. line spacing, indentation) in Microsoft Word can be absolutely exasperating! If you use Word on a regular basis, *you know* what I'm talking about.

Word processing not only works flawlessly in WordPerfect, it is incredibly easy to incorporate, format, and manipulate tables, pictures, and multimedia. I can concentrate on creating content without having to contend with software quirks.

Quattro Pro
-----------
Quattro Pro is a full-feature spreadsheet program like Excel. However, There is a disadvantage of using Quattro Pro. Since the vast majority of people use Excel rather than Quattro Pro or any other spreadsheet programs, help resources are not as abundant as Excel. This will almost definitely not be an issue if you're using Quattro Pro for designing simple spreadsheet but it may be a concern if you're planning on designing more complex spreadsheets that involve more advanced features such as macros.

Quattro Pro is also incompatible with Excel. You cannot expect to easily migrate an Excel file in Quattro Pro and vice versa. If you're newbie on spreadsheet, my advice: go with Excel.

Presentations X5
----------------
Presentations X5 works a lot like Microsoft Powerpoint. You can easily create presentation slide shows. Presentations X5 allows you to insert pictures, sounds, spreadsheets, multimedia files (such as MPEG, AVI), and other objects.

Extras
------
- Create PDF's
New in X5 is a PDF Tool which allows you to turn any WordPerfect document into a PDF file. It can even convert image-based PDF files into editable content! Use it to add comments or mark up your PDF files. PDF files can be password-protected.

You can create high-resolution or low-resolution PDF's (high-resolution PDF's are best suited for printing and low-resolution PDF's are best suited for posting on the Web.) Note: PDF Tool is only available in the Standard and Professional versions of the WordPerfect Suite.

---
WordPerfect Office X5's forte is in its word processing program, WordPerfect. (Any wonder why Corel named its office suite after its word processing program?) I am very impressed by how easy it is to create and edit content in WordPerfect. Presentations X5 is a superb program as well. As for Quattro Pro, I do have slight reservations about recommending it to someone who uses its more advanced features, not because of any flaws inherent in the program, but because help resources are relatively scanty compared to Excel. All in all, I'm thoroughly impressed with the WordPerfect Office suite. The bottom line: if you need a word processing program and have only rudimentary spreadsheet needs, the WordPerfect Office X5 suite is definitely the way to go.",Finally -- Frustration-Free Word Processing,False,1280361600,1.9459101490553128,1.0

But as usual, being free doesn't mean you get a lot of choices about the quality of the product.
First off, the media player itself is not without flaws. There is a pause in the music on albums between songs, a problem that many media players solved sometime in the 1990's.
Second, its hilarious to hear more static, hum, scratches, and low fidelity than when listening to albums. These are supposed to be ""digital"" downloads, and using a high quality DAC only accentuates the low quality of the files offered in the free music.
Its asking a lot to expect 96/128 bit files, but at this point in my life time is the limiting factor, and using the time consuming low quality music files is time better used ripping my own CD collection and enjoying at least 44 Mhz WAV files for digital files.

I don't know how it happened, I thought I ended the program before the final option of activating the process. It turned out to be very expensive, almost $70. Half of that goes to Turbo Tax and the other half goes to a bank that actually collects the returns and then they take both fees out before forwarding the remainder of the returns to my bank.
I use Turbo Tax every year and this was the first time this happened. The calls I made to Turbo Tax and the bank were for naught. Turbo Tax people basically said their program gives warning before the e-file choice is activated, and they discounted my assertion of how it occurred.

"I have owned Algebrator for about 3 years now, and the more I have used it, the more disappointed with it I become.  I will give you an example of a problem it cannot solve:

Find the zeroes of the following polynomial function:  3x^4+7x^3+69x^2+175x-150

I should be able to plug this equation into Algebrator and it should be able to find the value of x when the equation is equal to 0. Instead, however, when I click the Solve button, I get the following error:  ""Unable to solve equations of this type""

What the heck?

The zeroes, by the way, are -3, 2/3, 5i, and -5i.  It did not even find the zero integer -3!  When I typed this problem into the Mathway.com equation solver, it at least gave me the -3.  It didn't give me the other zeroes, but it did give me at least one of them.

This is just one of the many disappointments of Algebrator.  If you purchase this for College Algebra or Precalculus, you will be disappointed.  It's great for prealgebra, elementary, and most intermediate algebra problems, but when you try to use this to solve more difficult problems, you will be irritated when it tells you it cannot solve those types of problems.

"...then even a thirty-year-old woman can find much to love in this game!

"No surprise  it can't be bought here - Rootsmagic is sold through its web site, and occasionally old or extra install disks appear on Amazon.

I would rate it as decent but seriously lacking.

It is relatively easy to use - if you can use it at all.  It works well on Windows.  It works well on Ubuntu if you either jump through a bunch of hoops not for the tech faint of heart using variously Wine or Playonlinux (which one works varies), or spend $49 on Crossover for Linux.  These deficiencies make it pretty much useless for a great many people.  People have complained about these deficiences for years, and Rootsmagic has absolutely NO interest in fixing the deficiencies.

Rootsmagic has an app for smartphones and tablets that is the next thing to perfectly useless.  On tablets and phones it lets you view but not create nor edit databases.  ???  I put the app on my large tablet, and went to spend an afternoon at my sister's house, all excited that I could do some genealogical work, and I couldn't do anything at all!  Since even serious genealogical researchers increasingly work on tablets, this seriously limits who can use this software.

Also, to sync between devices, one must use Dropbox; there is no other method.  I have used Dropbox; if you remove a file from any device it removes from Dropbox and may be lost across all of your devices, and it isn't like anyone can keep extra files on most smartphones and tablets.

The reason why it is hard to get it to work in Mac and Linux, and some people can't even get it to work correctly in Windows, is that the program relies on other Windows software for much of its functionality.  For starters it will not run if Internet Explorer and Flash are not installed.  ???!!!!!!  It needs external gif support (GDI support), even if not using gif images.  It needs external XML support (Microsoft XML parsers) - which is ludicrous.  Rootsmagic's database is structured around XML.  It won't run if you don't have certain Windows fonts installed.

There are people running Windows 10 who can't run Rootsmagic, most likely because no Internet Explorer.  It HAS to be Internet Explorer, even though any HTML pages actually open in Chrome or Firefox on your computer.

Then there are the low key nuisances. For example:

You can't open notes without opening the individual first.

When entering data, you have to first open a form with the name, birth, death and burial information, then REOPEN the form to enter any other information, including notes and sources.

You can get a fact to stay open and apply it to multiple family members if you put a period at the beginning of the first line, or something?  It was as clear as mud - and certainly not intuitive.

You have to jump through about three different hoops several times to get private data you upload online to actually be treated as private.  The living people in my family ended up on Ancestry after I marked them as private!

There are quite a number of little bugs like that.

The program has really deteriorated since I selected it a version or two ago, when you could enter what you wanted in the date fields and it would be on your reports as you entered it, and you could include multiple spouses and their children on ancestor reports.  Those were key reasons for choosing this software.

And, last but not least, on the Rootsmagic support list, when I mention that Rootsmagic is hoaky when replying to people, the moderator won't post it, because noone is allowed to say anything negative about Rootsmagic.

"This will be the 11th year that I have used TurboTax to prepare my Federal tax return. Eleven years ago the user interface was a little difficult but workable. Last year the product was great and I expect it to continue to improve. Over the years, I have learned that the product is not infallible and some (but very few) mistakes were made, especially in the area of education credits and whether a ""Hope"" or ""Lifetime"" learning credit applies. I was able to successfully navigate through this problem but had to force it into the appropriate category. It remains important for the user to be aware of the tax laws so as not to be surprised by these problems.

I have always used the ""Basic"" version and have found that it meets all my needs including self-employment forms, capital gains, pensions, child care expenses, various tax credits such as the residential energy credit, and many, many more. I have never used the ""State"" product since state tax returns can be filed in New Mexico over the internet at no cost. You should check with your state to see if it has similar programs.

The only real problem with TurboTax is that the program is released early and before any federal forms are finalized. The update process is easy enough, but if you have a dial-up connection it will take a good bit of time. With a ""real"" high-speed connection such as cable, it's no sweat. This year it took me about a minute. I personally like to begin my return in December, so this is not a problem for me.

Another great feature is that you can copy personal information such as names, SSN, filing status, etc. from the previous year so you don't have to retype it this year.

Despite reservations I decided I would try to upgrade my Vista machine to Windows 8; I was hoping to cut down on the ridiculous load times of Vista. I downloaded the software directly from the Microsoft site. Installation appeared to go well. After nearly 3 hours it looked like all was well. As I was setting up preferences I then got the message that the installation failed and my previous operating system was then (thankfully) restored. I could not find any easy solution from Microsoft. Some suggestions were complex to the point where you would need an engineering degree. At this point I would just like a refund but it is difficult to find how to obtain one.  I am very disappointed that a modern operating system would fail to install like this; and it seems they unrealistically expect an average person to perform computer engineer level trouble shooting in order to make the program work. One more thing; you are required to re-install your programs (even Microsoft programs). This could be a headache and it seems they could have come up with a way to avoid having to do that.

"I aquired this cheaply, thank goodness. It is pretty much useless. Present Progressive Tense, OVER and OVER, e.g. I am speaking.  And that's about it for verb conjugations. In Spanish, the present tense is usually used to express this. For example, in Spanish, while ""hablo"" means ""I speak"", it also means ""I am speaking""; it is much more likely to say ""hablo"" than ""Yo estoy hablando"" for ""I am speaking"".  There are big differences in the way these forms are used in English and Spanish. Yet, I would suppose it's much easier to write a program to teach one verb ending than, say, 6, for the present tense...of course, you'll have the ser and estar verbs down, just probably not the difference between the two.

To be fair, it does cover a lot of irregular verbs. But, if you're only learning one conjugation, what's the point? You won't even know they're irregular.

Over and over, and all throughout this program, this is all there is. No verb conjugations, no explainations of what your saying. I can't speak for other languages, but as for Spanish, look elsewhere, unless you want to speak in one verb tense that is used way less often than its English counterpart. FSI is best for fluency, Pimsleur is great for getting pronounciation and grammer basics down, and if used in conjunction with vocabulearn, is fairly effective, fairly painlessly.",surprisingly bad,False,1152921600,4.624972813284272,0.0

The DVD of Susan Polgar is nicer to look at (better Quality/Layout), but has much less contents. For instance, every Colle player knows about the many ""Anti-Colle"" plans, which are advertised by GM Roman Dzindzichashvili, IM Pete Tamburro etc..

Nf3 e6 3.e3 Bf5 (or 3...Bg4), etc. Especially an early ...g6 - aiming for a King's Indian or Grunfeld position - is something which is regarded as ""a tough nut to crack"" (Aaron Summerscale, p. 78) for White.

Surprisingly, non of these Anti-Colle plans are even mentioned on Susan Polgar's DVD... Need I say more?

"I've been using this for several weeks after bad experiences with ArcSoft Showbiz and Ulead VideoStudio.  I find the interface to be simple and straightforward. I was up and editing very quickly.  There are a few quirks but they are easy to live with.  It uses only a timeline interface; I think adding a story-board mode would improve it, but I'm doing fine without it.
This editor has a rich feature set.  For instance, you can apply video filters to individual clips, groups of clips, or you can just put it on the entire output.  (Great for me, I can create one filter that compensates for the low saturation of my camera.)  You can also create your own templates for filters, text, etc.  It has a very intuitive way of changing the gamma on fades, too.  SMS also has better audio capabilities than the other tools I've tried.  And you can specify your own external audio editors, film capture tools, etc.
On large projects it can be slow to load, but it's pretty fast once it's going.  (Ulead VideoStudio is maddeningly slow all the time.)
This tool uses MyDVD as the DVD authoring tool.  It has some limitations but I've worked out a few tricks that keep me happy.
You can only capture as AVI, and when you ""create a DVD"" it generates AVI.  So I use the honestech tool to batch-convert to mpegs (which causes some problems)and I generate mpg files and THEN go to MyDVD.  Minor irritations.
Overall I recommend this highly.  I downgraded it on Ease of Use because they have a moronic online registration that rarely works.  You have to register both the product and the mpeg plug-in, so be ready to call Customer Service twice.

"Worst genealogy software I have used. I started FTM many years ago with version 1.0 and upgraded through version 10 of the original developers. Excellent products then. And made several big, thick books which were happily printed and shared with the rest of the extensive family. So, I updated, I thought, to FTM 2011 deluxe by Ancestry. What a bad experience !!!! All previous versions would update perfectly, without changes or hiccups, the works previously done over the years. But not FTM 2011 !!!! And it did not warn of this inability either in the instructions or in the publicity !! Just a message after importing the previous data that ""some data did not import correctly"" !!!!!! It messed up the formatting on books to make them childish and unusable. Such as not wrapping text around inserts or pictures like the original software which made the books look very professional.

Perhaps newbees and newcomers without any experience in genealogy may accept the crude limitations of the current software. Which is fine. But I am not about to redo all my previous, long and laborious, but delightful work and downgrade it to meet this new edition.

"I really like this software. I think it's a good option for people who like photoshop but can't afford the price tag. There's a lot going on here. You can edit your photos, in so many different ways. There's the standard things of course, rotation, one click fix, etc, but it really does have some super cool adjustments and effects and they're pretty user friendly. Some that aren't available with photoshop, that I could have used a bunch of times over, like smart carver, which lets you cut objects out of your picture then scales it back to size.

It's pretty user friendly if you're already familiar with photoshop, if not, it may take some getting used to. You can work with layers and masks, just like in photoshop. The program has a lot of the same tools, different types of brushes to choose from, which I haven't delved much into yet as I've mostly used it for photo enhancement. It has the shapes to (with a limited number of shapes and I haven't looked into if there are more available, but probably).

There is a learning center that pops up when you start to use a new tool, so if you are unfamiliar with the program, instruction is right there for you. There's also a section for instant adjustments and management of photos.

One of the best things is the photo retouching tools. You can do a lot with portraits with this program. Your selfies will never be the same.

I think if you're looking for a program like this, this is a great one, especially if you're already familiar with Photoshop. If you're thinking about getting Photoshop, but it's out of your price range, this is something you should consider. Also, if you're a rookie with stuff like this, I'd have to say this program is more user friendly than Photoshop. Is it as good?

"For anyone who wants their 64bit wide screen desktop PC to act like your portable tablet, you'll love it.  For everyone else, this is a disaster!  I wish there were negative stars for this one.  I've been with Microsoft since the early DOS days when we configured IRQ's by hand and this is just a mess (including Win 8.1 and 8.0).

First, you'll need to go the internet and find yourself a startbutton application, then seek the internet for everything else, like starting-up in desktop mode, adding the control panel back, disabling stuff to protect you from installing your own programs (!), etc.  With about a day's effort, you can succeed in getting it to look like Windows 7 and be a normal functioning desktop (or laptop) PC.  Then it will feel like a PC instead of MS trying to get you to go to the Store and buy Angry Birds for your desktop.

If you're used to Windows Media Player and Winamp, you'll be surprised when the music ""App"" launches and you get this giant solid blue screen with a mini drag bar on the bottom left.  Don't worry, if you've lived through previous versions of Windows, you can figure out how to associate mp3's with a real PC program.

Don't make this mistake - I had switched to Windows 8.1 Preview because I thought it offered some relief over Windows 8.0.  Well, on 1/16, my PC started rebooting itself.  It said it would reboot every 2 hours because the preview edition was now turned off (I didn't know it would turn off!).  So I try to upgrade to 8.1 but I can't because you can only do that with the Store App (or an iso file, which didn't work because my key code was no longer valid for the 8.1P).  The Store wouldn't connect because my version of windows was no longer supported.  So I backed all the way back to 8.0 again.  What I didn't realize with the ""refresh"" is that *all* of my programs would be deleted - yes, including all my hand additions to my music recording software - gone!!!  But my documents stayed behind.  Then, I upgraded to Windows 8.1 through the Store.  At this time, I switched my account to reference my Microsoft account (something I should have done the first time).  Now when it completed - my *Documents* folder was deleted (because my user name changed to the MS account name).  No way to get them back - not even in the ""Old"" directory.  I should have backed up *everything* to the network drive before touching a thing on here.  I downloaded some programs that search the drive to recover files and that actually got back about 70% of my missing files.

So beware of any maintenance like changing versions and always backup everything.  If you can, I recommend waiting until Windows starts releasing operating systems that look like they're made for PC's instead of shoe-horning a tablet OS into a desktop.  Or seriously consider switching to a Linux OS (I use both).  If you have no other choice but to get a WIndows 8 PC, do some research on the web first for the settings changes that most people do and have that handy when you first start it up to make the experience better.  Note that the right mouse key will do mostly nothing and you'll need to keep hitting the ""Windows"" button to get around, which will feel very different, until you get it back to desktop mode.",This is just awful!!,False,1390089600,2.8332133440562166,0.0

"As a contract management specialist, I have to maintain a current and up to the minute list of more than 1000 contract actions that pan over a life cycle of up to 5 years.  For each contract action, there are 40+ attributes that I need to keep track.  Moreover, working with several interrelated offices within the organization, I also have to generate different reports on these contract actions for my internal and external customers.  It would continue to be a daunting task if I keep track of these contract actions on a workbook.  Through my knowledge of Integrating Microsoft Office applications, I determined that Access 2010 would be the best application for me to keep track of data on these items.  So over the past month, I have spent time developing a contract management database.  To ensure that I spend the minimal amount of time designing and developing this database, I have decided a take a quick course to brush my skills on Microsoft Access 2010.  As a satisfied learner of another IT Training course (Microsoft Excel 2010), I contacted Dream Force LLC and inquired about availability of training materials on Access 2010 and Database Management.  I was pleased to find out that this IT Training provider offers Access 2010 course on DVD for only $39.99, the same price for Excel 2010 training that I obtained a little less than a year ago and more affordable than competing training products.  And once again, Dream Force LLC has trained me to become an advanced user of Access 2010 in no time.  With 140+ topics covering basic skills as `creating tables', shining the `dance floor', `one-to-one relationship', `one-to-many relationship', `enforcing referential integrity', `forms', `queries', and `reports' to challenging tasks such as `creating macro' (running a set of tasks) and restructuring the database.  From soup to nuts, I was able to move current data from an ""old school"" workbook to an advanced database I have just developed, showcasing a Front-End Switchboard Terminal, ready for users to enter data, retrieve information, print reports and update existing records.  This training program comes complete with 3 levels (Basics, Intermediate and Advanced), complemented with Exercise Files, Instructor Notes, Review Questions and Answers.  This way, you can be assured that you will get all the tools you need to learn and excel in every topic.

What you need to know about database management and Access 2010, this course will take you there. The video lessons show the LIVE (production) Access environment.

"Not for beginners. I'm not sure how many times it lets you download it, but I successfully downloaded and opened both the PC and the Mac versions on one serial number. The interface looks the same on both platforms, and is not easily intuitive. I can see it is built for professionals who might want to perform the same task on many photos at the same time. I mostly just crop and lighten, and it was not readily obvious to me how to do those tasks. On the Mac, iPhoto can crop and lighten easily, even fix some easy flaws. When PhotoShop became a monthly subscription, I switched to Photoshop Elements, which is the same price as this, and at least it has a Guided routine for idiots like me, and is easier to figure out. Not sure I would recommend this to anyone other than event and wedding photographers, but the price is reasonable if you have the patience to learn it. If you want free, there's still Gimp and Acorn (I think) that does very basic photo editing.

Update: the second time I worked with it, I found it puts an .xmp extension on the photo files so none of my other photo programs can open it, and I could not figure out how to do simple things like export a photo as just a .jpg or even close the file.

"What follows is the review of someone who has more than 25 years on both sides of the Unix/Windows line and who owns no stock that would benefit from the sales of either.
When you read all the reviews below, you might get confused, with ratings from 1 to 5 stars and the obvious pro- and anti-Microsoft commentary (this IS a Redhat review, right? Why do people feel compelled to throw in the Microsoft jabs?  Very juvenile!) - so if you're among the confused, let me help you out.
The clue to reality is found in the posts themselves - as you notice that the majority of reviewers feel obliged to tell you what kind of system they've installed (or not) Linux, right down to the drive types and the mouse pad they use.
Why do they feel you need this information, which anywhere else would be totally boring and even irrelevant?  Yes - you guessed it.  Linux still has problems supporting a number of hardware platforms and devices - period.  And, when new devices come out, Linux is slower than molasses in supporting them.
Well, this level of ""polish"", if that's the word I want, is what you get with a lot of ""open source"" software - sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, often critical or obvious features are missing.  But hey - don't whine.  ""Everything is going to be fixed in the next version...would you please donate some money?""....
When Linux arrived on the scene, the CONCEPT was practically spiritual - at one point I thought the Congress might rewrite the Preamble to the Constitution to say that all men were entitled to life, liberty, LINUX and the pursuit of happiness.  It was all so very, very egalitarian.  Free stuff....well, until someone started charging for it.
It was the OS version of free love and hippie beads.
Years later, Linux still doesn't measure up.  It may sound like an oxymoron that Linux hides behind its ""openness"", but that is precisely what it does.  You're never entitled to scream VERY loud about its shortcomings, because, after all, it is free....or it only costs a few bucks, and hey - it's....OPEN!  Have some pity on the poor people who are working so hard to contribute to Linux, you heartless (grep .astard myreview > truth.txt).
Linux has promise.  In fact, lots of promises.  The fact that it's the same promises they were making years ago is merely a speedbump along the pathway to Nirvanalux.  And no matter how fast you drive it, Linux can never seem to outrun its kludge.
So, I run it - mostly as a development platform for work, before running anything on the real deal (Unix or Windows - the operating systems that actually work).  Crash my Linux, who cares?  I never compile anything on it that doesn't go to backup first.
And for those who claim constant crashes with Windows, I won't call them liars.  I have an NT server that I can't remember when I booted it, a 2000 server literally running from the day it was installed a couple of years ago, but then again, I RTFM and I'm a trained system administrator.  Could that be the difference?  Probably not - my wife's Windows 98 ran for about 6 years straight until she upgraded to 2000 and she has never seen the BSOD.
Notice I'm not telling you what platforms these systems are running on - because it doesn't matter.  If you're seeing the BSOD in Windows, the most probable device causing your failure is YOU.",Don't Be Confused,False,1080777600,3.1780538303479458,0.0

"It was great to have a GPS in Italy and the price of the SD card was fine. I was using a Garmin 760 GPS unit that works very well in the US. Nevertheless, I discovered that you should not expect it to work as well as it does with your US map. Too often, I found myself passing the exit before I could identify it from the GPS instructions. Probably, that was sometimes my own fault in trying to understand the mispronounced Italian street names that were identified with too much information--sort of like trying to read the overhead route directions that contained directions to several places, all in a foreign language.
The quirkiness of the guidance was annoying. For example, on one occasion I was on on a major road (comparable to an interstate road in the US) and the GPS said to drive on it for 60 miles.  I knew that to be correct, having been on the road before. I drove about 10 miles at about 80 miles an hour (yet being passed by the other drivers). Suddenly, the GPS started telling me to ""go 500 yards and make a legal U-turn."" I knew I had another 50 miles to go so I ignored that instruction (and it was a physical impossibility to make a U-turn on such a road). For another 5 minutes, it kept telling me to make that U-turn, after which it stopped doing so and reflected the fact that I had another 45  miles to go to my destination.
Despite these issues, I recommend the SD card for anyone driving in Italy. Overall, it did its job, and if you realize it is quirky, you will be OK. It is not perfect, but it is better than trying to read foreign maps and asking for directions when there is a language barrier. If nothing else, its pronunciation of Italian street names will keep you amused.",Any port in a storm,True,1256947200,3.218875824868201,0.0
"Wow, what can I say?  Been looking for a simple recording system for our old Sony HanycamVision HI8 movie camera bought back in 2000 to convert the tapes to DVD.  I knew all along there was something out there.  Well, here it is.  Everything worked as advertised. There are a couple of hiccups, of course.  But if you have a little patience everything will be just fine.  Remember that you will be recording at the tape speed, not 4x, 8x, 24x etc.... So, sit back and enjoy your old home movies or whatever tape you are recording.  The Dazzle itself is very simple to use as well as the software Pinnacle Studio 12.  To use all of the features of Pinnacle Studio 12 you will have to register the product online.  This is recommended because if you decide not to, many of the features will be grayed out and a warning box stating you need to register online will appear if not.  So, make sure the computer you are using has an internet connection.  Definitely make sure the Dazzle will work on the computer you choose first.  Go ahead and install Pinnacle Studio 12 without registering and make sure it will capture and save your tape recording.  If it doesn't work, find out why and or use another computer.  This way you won't have to dink around with the problem of the serial number / activation key if you have to use another computer.  This is what I do know it works on perfectly: Sony HandycamVision model CCD-TRV88 NTSC using HI8 tapes and converting to DVD-R on computer system:  Toshiba laptop model A665-S6086 using Windows 7 64bit, 4gigs ram, Intel Core I3.  I chose this over my other computers that run XP or Ubuntu on 32 bit os.  So, 64 bit ran great. No problems with the webcam either, as some people have mentioned. Things to look out for that I ran into:  S video, as another person pointed out, will not fit properly into the Dazzle itself.  Interesting, huh?  Bad design.  Luckily I have may different S video cables and just screwed the protective sleeve off of the end of one and was able to make it work just fine.  Otherwise it will be composite only.  When you are ready to start your recording, I would recommend turning off your internet connection and disable your virus program.  This way it will help keep some of your other programs from trying to do background processes while recording.  My problem:  I have Norton and it loves to run background scans when it thinks nothing is happening.  Problem is, it can be taxing if you know what I mean.  When it started up it immediately messed up the sync of the audio to video while recording.  Audio was 1 to 2 seconds behind the video. I wouldn't be surprised if other programs could cause this too.  So look out for this.  Just be sure you are not online when disabling your virus program.  You can try silent mode with Norton, but if you have been at it for hours don't take a chance at this frustration.  Also, make sure you are using USB 2.0 or you will get a warning saying it needs the speed of this.  No USB 1.1.  I found this out trying to use an older laptop from 2005.  I tried to use this with USB 1.1, Windows XP 32 bit, 1 gig of ram, Intel Celeron 1.7 ghz, No Way!  Don't waste your time on this.  If you use maxium quality, which is pretty darn good if you ask me from HI8 to DVD-R, I was only able to get about an hour on a 4.7gig DVD.  Crazy, huh?  Or you can cram many hours at lower quality.  If you have the patience and the ability to follow the directions, life will be good with Dazzle. Remember:  You will need lots of hard drive space too, unless you use the option of direct to DVD feature.  But this leaves no room for error, like some other program screwing up the audio/video sync. Good luck.",Dazzle DVD Recorder PLUS with Pinnacle Studio 12,True,1301356800,0.0,1.0

Ran sooo much quicker, even opening files, folders, calculator-- anything. 6 startup entries gone with the wind. Downloaded AVGfree and runs so much nicer and faster.

I have an email reminding me to renew, with all their other spam, yet they have altered my account to show i was never signed up. You have to sign up, and give and use an email. Much cheaper than buyig online direct though. If you have at least a 1 Gz (P III) processor, it is not so bad  on autoupdate, and yet it will tell you when asked that you are up to date and protected and when you log in, and maunually check, it downloads updates, so apparently it was NOT up up date. They should TELL you that you need to use 2 different emails for 2 different pc's. Surely , i am not the only one with more than 1 pc? And god help you if you forget your password.

"15 years ago, when I was old enough to buy my first PC, I chose Norton as my antivirus.  It was pretty good software, lightweight and powerful.  Over the years security products evolved with more features, and while Norton added those features, it got bogged down by them and became more bloated and slower.  I stopped using Norton products several years ago when this line was called systemworks, but decided to give 360 a shot on my Windows 7 PC.

Installation was fairly simple, and there isn't much to configure, which can be good for novice users.  I personally would prefer more options.  The software is pretty and seems pretty friendly.  It handles antivirus and malware protection, system cleaning, and even annoying popups on my browser to ""warn of unsafe websites"".  Although there are programs out there that use fewer resources, this version of Norton seemed much easier on my system.

I am a bit concerned over not getting to use the software in 1 year if I don't ""renew my subscription"".  I will probably not do that, but we will see.

"As is a habit of mine, I tend to troll movie sites in my free time, checking up on news and seeing what's being filmed where, who's in what, and so on. In March, [...] had a spotlight on Natasha Richardson to commemorate her life and acting achievements--it has been one year since she passed. Looking at her filmography I noticed that Wild Child was last movie she made. I began combing websites like Wal*Mart and Target for the movie, but it is not sold in stores. I wasn't going to buy a movie solely because it was Natasha Richardson's final appearance without first making sure it was half-way decent. Thank the Lord for movie websites. That is how I was, finally, able to sit down and watch this movie. I have watched interviews with the cast and behind the scenes videos all over Youtube and one thing is for sure: I love this movie. Call me crazy, but me, a college student, is completely enamored with it.

Looking at the film in scope, is it original, no, it is not. It is kind of a twist on Mean Girls meets a British Academy for young ladies. There is nothing especially remarkable about this film--not in the slightest, which is why I only give it three stars, but that rating merely reflects the film as a public whole. Personally, for me, this film is way better than Mean Girls was. Mean Girls was raunchy and I was about ready to strangle Rachel McAdams for just about everything. You see, I believe that movies only work if the characters are dynamic--static characters are a waste of everyone's time and money whether literature or silver screen. The character's in this movie are not static--even the snotty head girl has to deal with change.

It is recommended that this movie would only be good for preteens up through thirteen years of age--personally, I wouldn't let a child watch this until they were thirteen years of age. The crudeness of British vocabulary and Poppy's mouth was, at first, startling; I know Emma Roberts as the beloved detective Nancy Drew, not as a teenager I would personally tie to chair for her attitude. As such, though, is Emma Roberts' character, and having seen her do nothing like this and be completely out of her element in the British countryside was an eye-opener. For sure, Emma Roberts can be the brat as she can be the darling and she does, by the end of this film make that predicted transformation. She does, of course, push the limits along the way.

All-in-all, the heartwarming nature of the story contained within this roll of film is one I find worth paying for, every cent. Emma Roberts is a delight and British cast, most of whom I had never seen before outside of Natasha Richardson, as the meadmistress, and the matron (most notably Moaning Myrtle in the Harry Potter series) and who were a delight to watch interact. The male lead was handed off to one Alex Pettyfer [upcoming Beastly] and while his role was small, he held his own within the film amongst all the other ladies; I applaud him for his bravery. Natasha Richardson, though, with even a smaller role than Alex, who plays her son, was a delight to watch light up the screen. It was almost like seeing her in a new movie and that she really still was out there, making movies and being a doting wife and mother. Her final role is a character that is a tribute to her as a person and as gentle a leader as her role as Liz from the Parent Trap all those years ago. While I do wish she had played a larger part, her character was integral for the story to move forward and it made it worth while.

If you are looking for a movie that is sassy, full of quirky quotes that I personally love (allusions to Alice in Wonderland), and laughter as notorious as my own, Wild Child is a movie I recommend with no hesitations. As long as you understand that you are getting a comedy that is entirely British in nature, but with a heart that can be distinguished from neither country--buy Wild Child. Enjoy Emma Roberts as a brat and then a starlet and watch Natasha Richardson's final performance, one that deserves more credit than it received.

"I used to use Poser MANY years ago (God only knows what version it was, but I don't think they had animation yet!) So I'm coming back to it now, and there have been so many changes (and it's been such a long time) that it's more like learning a new program than anything else. Poser has amazing capabilities. You are not stuck with buying thousands of dollars' worth of props and models if you ever want to do anything with it (which is what a lot of people seem to think.) And yes, you can create your own characters, props, materials, walk cycles, etc etc etc...

 The major, MAJOR problem I have with 2010 is that it is absolutely and completely impossible to get the Poserfusion plugin to work with Cinema 4D r14. That is not a good situation. Then, when you get to the page on the SmithMicro site that supposedly has a plugin, you get the thrilling experience of entering the serial number from the back of the CD sleeve about 100 times and checking it over and over and over again and still being told that it's the wrong one. I'm still trying to get through to tech support about this. So that's a real issue. If this plugin is supposed to be part of what you're buying, then it needs to work.

Overall, though, what makes this so worthwhile is the fact that once the next edition came out, this one dropped to literally 1/10th of the price, something that normal human beings can actually afford. This is something that all software manufacturers desperately need to learn from (and maybe one day they'll wise up.

I do not understand all the hate on Windows 8. It is a much snappier OS than Windows 7. 8.1 brought a lot of good fixes to 8.,Love it!,True,1388620800,0.0,1.0
"Edit: Back to Windows 7.

Windows 8 is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. I guess that is not entirely true, it is a solution for a problem Microsoft has, not I.

The UI is flashy and gets in the way. It wants to be notice. I don't want to notice my OS. It should be invisible so I can get what I need to done. I don't want to interact with it, play with it. I had to search for regedits to make my synaptics touchpad not trigger the charm bar if I even scrapped the left side of the pad. Either that or install a generic driver.

No native drivers for igfx by intel, windows provided one crashes and resets. When it resets, any video that would be playing in a browser would only play audio. The fix is to close and reopen the browser.

A November update came along. EVERYTHING slowed down for me. My SSD was relegated back to HDD speeds. Browser took a good 5 seconds to open, as did OneNote/Word/Excel. ON W7, which I am back on now? Instantaneous. Another update broke all my Metro apps. Repair function in the store did nothing to repair it. Uninstalling and reinstalling the apps did nothing to repair it. Refreshing the computer would leave the apps in tact and would do nothing to repair it.

Search - inefficient and unreliable. 0 matches in apps, 5 matches in settings, 10 in files. Lets display apps where there are 0 apps! Makes sense! Quite frequently the search wouldn't bring up a result until I finished spelling the whole thing, completely. One letter from completion, nothing. Enter final letter, there it is. Makes no sense.

Training consumers for ads - Minesweeper, Xbox Music, advertisements. Xbox music will match your music and serve up the censored version from their servers rather than play the one locally from your drive so they can serve you ads. Ads in minesweeper? No thanks. Give me back the low graphics ad free one. It is plain as day where MS is going with this and I do not like it one bit.

Workflow - extremely disruptive. Changing the entire screen to open something up messes up your train of though, especially when working in number intensive programs or you are in the certain place in a long document. Much like how I forget what I was going to do when I enter a room. What did I come here to get again? Happens a lot for me, especially when I'm working on something monotonous.

Cleaning up after install. I really don't like having icons pollute the startup screen after an install. It is unnecessary and annoying and indicates a lack of polish.

2 different browsers. How is this a good idea? 2 different browsers, each with their own history, extensions, bookmarks, etc. Why deal with this added complexity? I ended up forcing Chrome to disable the Metro browser because I did not want every link I clicked in anything remotely connected to metro popping up that browser. That worked well for a while until I went into Metro mode for whatever reason and got permanently stuck in Metro mode. I'm not blameless in that one because maybe my regedit had something to do with it.

No clock. Seems small but it was annoying not having a clock viewable at all times. Full screen mode=no taskbar=no clock. I tried to compromise with an app called the Time but that thing leaked memory like crazy, upwards of 1GB in ram by a clock used up.

The mousing around. OMG, the mousing around. All this dragging and sliding and flinging. I'm not here to play around. If my workflow requires mostly mouse inputs, then I won't have my hands on the keyboard. Shortcuts are inefficient so I have to click and drag, click and drag. Hit a hot corner and carefully go down so it doesn't lose focus. Everything requires further mouse travel. Right click is inconsistent, always a surprise. Back button on mouse is inconsistent. Sometimes it goes back, sometimes it doesn't.

Metro App startup times. I thought these things were lightweight but some of them take 4-5 seconds to startup. I thought they were going for Android startup speeds, near instantaneous.

I could go on. It makes me angry that a lot of people are dismissive of other users concerns. Oh, they are just parroting what some tech blog said. I assure you I am not. I am frustrated because I have wasted hours and hours of my life trying to get the OS to do what I want it to do.

The speed slowdown plus my browser being stuck was the last straw and I uninstalled Windows 8. I like W7. Windows 8 is like a service pack with some great improvements but a lot of added, unremovable baggage. I loved the pastel coloring and the flatness of Windows 8, I found it a lot more attractive and clean than W7. I loved the explorer ribbon interface which made everything more efficient to get to. I loved the file management system and how I could pause and start each transfer individually.

In short, I would have had no problem upgrading for $100+ to Windows 8 minus metro rather than this $40 waste of hours of my life. Maybe these issues will be resolved in the future, maybe they won't.

"Once I figured out how to use it, I found this product fairly powerful in its ability to generate labels.  I especially liked the ability to edit individual labels once generated.  The program is pretty flexible although I was dismayed at the number of features that it lacked such as allowing access to every single Address Book field (it only lets you use Spouse Name but not Friend or Assistant, for example).  There are other features that are found in Microsoft Word's label applet that are more powerful, such as using Boolean logic to be able to generate more complete labels.  Of course, if Pages, AppleWorks or even (God forbid) Address Book had a real label making feature, there would be no need to shell out the extra bucks for this program!
Now, my real complaint, which is about the company.  They put out two products- Labels & Envelopes and Business Cards.  Clearly they are both the same product with only subtle differences, such as the templates that they come with.  Business Cards does not even allow access to the Address Book, other than one's own personal entry (even though they imply that they do).  They should combine both products into one and maybe charge a little more than the cost of one for it.

"As a parent of two kids, I became increasingly concerned that my ever expanding collection of videotaped (VHS-C) family movies would erode over time due to oxidation of film surfaces.  With that in mind, I recently purchased a Dell XPS 400 (Dual Core Pentium D Processor, 1 GB RAM)PC and had decided on the Pinnacle Studio Plus 9 AV/DV software and PCI card package in which to initiate the VHS-C transfer to DVD project. I have been using the software for nearly a week and am very satisfied with the results.

The Pinnacle package comes with a PCI card (that is mounted in an available slot in the PC), software, a ""blueBox"" and cables.  The blueBox is an interface that allows you to connect a VCR or camera in which to deliver the analog signal to the PC.  The software has three primary tabs: Capture, Edit and Make Movie. The first step is to capture the analog source.  The capture tab has a ""Diskometer"" with two fly-out panels so that you can monitor memory usage and adjust the audio and video settings of the captured source.  Next, the edit tab allows one to create chapters, albums, special effects, etc.  There are so many features in the edit tab that I've still yet to explore all of them.  If one desires a straight unedited version of the video, you need only to click and drag the frames into the toolboxes and move on to the Make Movie tab. Once you've selected the desired digital media (i.e. DVD, VCD) and quality of resolution, the tab renders the video into final form (which can take a half hour or more for a high quality DVD on a fast computer)and burns the video onto a disk.

I have made several DVDs at this point and have not experienced any dropped frames in videos or PC system crashes.  I think it certainly helps to have a powerful PC that is up to the task of video capturing (be forewarned, however, video capturing is a big time memory hog.  I am contemplating on getting a 250 GB external hard drive just for my video clips). The finished DVD quality is really quite astounding.  I now have a piece of mind that I am able to preserve valuable video movies on a more permanent and durable media.

I would whole-heartedly recommend the Pinnacle package to anyone that is interested in transfering VHS tapes to DVDs.  Just make sure you meet the minimum system requirements outlined on the package (even so, you may want to upgrade PC specifications)and to take the time to learn the software (a 290 page book comes with the package).",Great Product!,False,1135814400,0.0,1.0

My system is a AMD 945 quad core, a ATI 5570 1 Gig video care, 4 Gig's memory and about 3 t'bytes of storage free. I could not get Avid studio to render a file longer than 15 minutes in ACHD 1920 x 1080. Sony Vegas does it without a problems (so far up to an hour of content). The price on Vegas 11 HD suite is amazing ($81 here on amazon prime).

I'm having to learn the system, but Vegas and its supporting products (soundforge, and the DVD/BR program) work well together.

One of the things I like about Vegas is now with 10 video and AUD. TRACK I use Vegas for a mix and finish in soundforge.

It's a powerful program and perhaps hard to use if you haven't use a NLE before, but I got up and running within a week. I won't be going back to Avid Studio - great concept, poorly implemented.

I do some web video's for clients and so far Vegas has performed flawlessly.

The slide show function is very easy to use as it the pan/zoom facility. Lots of good additional content like music, title editor, and effects.

I use a CanonVixia H100 and a Nikon D7000 for video and the rendered files are amazing at 1920, 30 frames. Just ask my cat who attacked a YellowLeg shore bird from a wildlife video I&iexcl;m going.

"***UPDATE 11/30/14: Changing my rating to 1 Star. I can not believe that QB charged my credit card $2.16 after I finally broke down and gave them my C/C information, because it was the only way to activate my payroll and I had Federal and State Reports that were overdue (since I was hesitant to give my credit card information to quickbooks when I didn't owe them any money).  The charge is for a payroll back in August - a full 3 mos prior to the current activation!  I still have never incurred any valid charges from Quickbooks, as my previous payroll subscription(expired 10/14) included 3 Employees at no additional charge, and my current payroll (activated 11/14) includes 1 Employee at no additional charge.  I have only had 1 employee all year long - and yet they are charging me extra!!!  Quickbooks - you are guilty of FRAUD! You force people to give you their credit card to activate a subscription that is already bought and paid for on Amazon, and then you charge them for services that are already included in the purchase.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I WILL BE LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE TO QUICKBOOKS THIS WEEK POSSIBLY PEACHTREE.

***Previous review 11/25/14: I am giving this product a 2 star rating due to the fact that Quickbooks has stooped to a record low, in the areas of greed and unethical business practices.  After spending an hour with support (and speaking with 2 supervisors), I can verify that the new version of Enhanced payroll CAN NOT BE ACTIVATED WITHOUT ENTERING YOUR CREDIT CARD OR CHECKING ACCOUNT INFORMATION, AND AGREEING ELECTRONICALLY TO AUTOMATICALLY RENEW EACH YEAR, UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EACH YEAR'S CURRENT PAYROLL SUBSCRIPTION.  The new Payroll version only allows 1 employee at no additional cost and then charges you $2 per month for each additional user.  The software tracks your payrolls each month, so that as you add or delete employees it just bills you whatever it determines you should pay that month, per your initial Agreement.  Because I have only 1 employee on my payroll, I should not have to provide a Credit Card, because I should never be billed anything.

Additionally, I will NEVER purchase a Subscription Renewal from quickbooks because they are very overpriced compared to Amazon, where I have been buying my Payroll and QB Pro for many years - so again, they have NO VALID REASON FOR DEMANDING MY CREDIT CARD OR REFUSING TO ACTIVATE MY ALREADY BOUGHT AND PAID FOR PAYROLL SUBSCRIPTION.  The reason that they are requiring the Credit Card is so that a year from now, they can automatically renew your payroll subscription and charge your credit card ""the current price at the time of renewal"".  Customer Support reassured me repeatedly that they would immediately cancel my Auto-Renewal as soon as I provided my Credit Card and they activated my payroll account.  They also reassured me that they only were requiring a credit card in order to provide great customer service by insuring that no one would have any interruptions in their service.  Really?

Why would anyone be required to provide a credit card to activate a service that they have already paid for and will not be incurring any future costs or charges to use?  Why would any reputable company also require you to Electronically Agree to an Automatic Subscription Renewal, but tell you not to worry - they will cancel your automatic renewal as soon as you agree to it and enter your credit card or checking account information along with it?  Why would an ethical company not provide for any means for their customers to be able to activate the payroll without a credit card and agreeing to the automatic renewal, if they were not going to add additional employees and not renew automatically and not be incurring any additional charges?  An honest and ethical company would just not allow me to add any employees to payroll unless I provided satisfactory billing information.  Apparently Quickbooks does not value fairness, honesty or ethical business practices.

DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  I have been a loyal QB Pro & QB Enhanced Payroll user for too many years to count.  I have put up with the onslaught of popup ads and solicitations to upgrade to overpriced a la carte services and extras, and with the hit or miss overseas customer service for many years and still I have recommended it to many  clients and friends because it seems to be one of the better solutions for many small businesses - that is why I still gave it 2 stars, but you have stooped to an all time low in greed and, questionable business practices.  You were always on the edge, but you have finally crossed the line, from aggressive sales tactics to deception and opportunistic means.  I would highly recommend that anyone not already on Quickbooks or Enhanced payroll, finds other solutions before you get in too deep.",They Charged my Credit Card after assuring me they wouln't!,True,1416441600,4.442651256490317,0.0

"Since the other review for this is so horrible, I'm going to go ahead and write one even though I've only used this simulator for about 2 weeks. I'll update as I learn more.
First off let me say that I am an electrician and also a student of industrial process control. So if you are anything along those lines from apprentice to engineer than this is going to be a good purchase for you. If you are not familiar with the function of ladder logic and the associated items that work with it then this is a good way to figure it out.
This product comes with programs for both function block and ladder logic. I am not at all familiar with function block right now so I won't comment on that portion.
You will need to understand the functions of the icons before beginning and they are all in the instruction manual that is included on the CD. The instruction manual is pretty decent and it does a good job of explaining what icons are what but you will have to take the time to read it carefully so that when you get into the simulator you are not confused by all the icons and how to address them.
This is a great setup for learning the basics but if you want to get to the ""programmer"" level then I would suggest taking a PLC class along with this to learn some of the more common programs like RSlogix, Siemens and Omron.  For my purposes which is simply to learn the basics of PLC programming the simulator is an excellent choice for only 20 dollars.

"The program is horrible.  It cannot recognize basic words.  I have had the program for several weeks and have been ""training"" it to my voice, which is a normal adult male voice.  I am a natural English speaker with clear diction.  However, the pogram cannot recognize basic words even when I speak slowly and clearly.

""Often I've asked myself why I'm watching this movie"" becomes
""Often I've asked myself I my offspring this movie""

""Amber asked me that the other day"" becomes
""Over will as me that the other day""

"I recently purchased the Scrapbook Factory Deluxe ver. 2.0 software.  So far, I believe that this is one of the best software products on the market today.  It is very user-friendly, and without much of a learning curve. You can produce impressive scrapbooking pages, in a matter of minutes.  However, the problem comes in when you create scrapbooking pages with more than 12 pictures and text on a page.  If you do not print that page as soon as you finish creating it, trying to save it and print it later, is impossible.  What happens usually, is that the page with all of your hard work will usually crash, and you end up starting all over.  This can be quite disappointing.  Secondly, even with a new printer, when you put a full page border on your page, there have been many occasions, where the border would not print correctly on the bottom of the page, and some of it would get chopped off.

"One would think that backup software named True Image would create an accurate image of your computer disk. But it doesn't. Buried three menu levels deep is a list of files that it excludes by default from even a disk image backup. Some like hiberfil.sys can generally be ignored without problem, but also included is the Chrome/User directory. So no Chrome cookies or user settings are restored. If Acronis is not actually making a true disk image, what else is it hiding from me? Also, I had to type my encryption password four times during a test restore before it was recognized. Maybe I mis-typed it the first time, but not twice after that. Having done more than a few restores from backup in the past 35 years, I have to have absolute trust in the backup software I use. Acronis falls far short of earning that trust.

To add insult to injury, half of the main menu features are attempts to sell cloud backup space and backup for phones and other devices. I want no nonsense backup software, not shill-ware. Finally, despite thousands of words in English in the interface, the main menu is a set of cryptic icons with no text. I guess that made sense to someone at Acronis.

"I came to PC-cillin with high expectations, based on other reviews.  And like other reviewers, I'm impressed by (1) its low price, (2) the quality of its antivirus program and the frequency with which definitions are updated, (3) the fact of free tech support by phone and e-mail, and (4) the whole program's relatively low impact on computer memory and speed.

On the other hand, knowledgeable users seem concerned about the quality of its firewall - a concern corroborated by PC Mag's new review ([...]) and by the failure to cloak ports on my computer.  Moreover, the spyware filter failed to catch two suspicious files flagged by another leading program.  And the antispam filter has only about an 80% success rate in my experience.

More worrisome are the bugs.  At first PCC would hang while attempting to download updates -- a problem eventually fixed by uninstalling the program (which I had loaded from a CD) and reinstalling it from the Trend Micro website.  But two more issues have been unresolvable despite countless hours spent with various tech support people and several escalations.  First, the e-mail scanner fails to display a pop-up confirmation, leaving me less than certain that the scans are happening reliably.  Second, when I awaken my computer from stand-by, Outlook Express freezes while attempting to download messages, requiring me to restart Windows.  No need to recount the various suggestions made by the tech support people, some reasonable and some clearly silly.  All have failed.  (At one point, the T.M. level-2 techie had me scan for spyware with another company's program -- a tacit admission of PCC's inadequacy.)

I very much wanted (and expected) to like PC-cillin, but it has cost me an enormous amount of time and still doesn't work properly.  Even if I persevere and these issues are solved at some point, I'll probably disable the firewall and spyware features just as I've already gone back to another antispam program.",Doesn't live up to the hype,False,1101600000,2.6390573296152584,0.0

"My six year old son loves this game.  It does need to be run on an older PC though.  I tried it on my laptop running Windows 7 and loaded it in Compatibility Mode for Windows XP and set the screen for 256 colors but I cannot see the control menus.  I can run the game itself okay but the controls for the radio, exit buttons, etc. are fuzzy.  If you just click around to figure out what they do, some buttons work and some don't.  I put it on my older Pent II machine running Windows XP with a graphics accelerator card and it works just fine.  I can see everything well.  Maybe this is the problem another reviewer had when he said he couldn't see an exit button.  The only complaint my son has is there's no backhoe.  The equipment you use are dump truck, excavator, bulldozer, front end wheel loader, and a wrecking ball crane.  Some have attachments too like a hook for the crane.  The wheel loader has a forklift attachment.  The excavator gets an auger and a jackhammer.  You can switch stations on the radio (very cool) and get 360 views outside plus inside cab views.  You can do the missions or just drive around crashing into things.  Some of the buildings cannot be demolished.  I like the fact that the foreman is friendly and encouraging in the training mode.

I called them and asked them to match what their retailers offer.  They said they cannot price match their retailers and can only offer up to a 20% discount the subscription.  So I declined my annual subscription.

This QB 2012 + Enhanced payroll is an even better deal.  The QB 2012 Pro is $139 on Amazon and this makes the Enhance payroll $108, or 63% off their annual subscription.

I normally would give Intuit 3-4 stars for the software since it does what its supposed to, but has advertising baked into the product which is horrendously annoying.  Paid products should not have advertising, or at least have the option to disable it.

Intuit gets 1 star because their annual subscription is sneaky and fleeces customers who do not do their homework.  This goes for me... I hav ebeen fleeced many years and just woke up to this scam. Caveat emptor.

"I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance. This is also the case with NIS 2004. I've seen many reviews praising 2003 and cursing 2004. I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable. On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade. It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
PROS:
* Norton AntiVirus - Very pleased with this. Has a very nifty new feature (since 2003), where a small box pops up near your traybar saying that an application is waiting for a scan of a specific file. NAV has also added new signatures and logic for finding spyware in this version. As usual, it will find Viruses, Trojans and other nastiness on your computer, in your email and in your chat sessions.
* Firewall and intrusion detection - Has worked fine for me in both NIS 2003/2004. This features has been nicely improved on in NIS 2004. The main new features I like is the fact that when a program first tries to access the internet, you can temporarily or permanently choose whether to permit or block ALL traffic for this application, or have the system automatically configure settings if it recognizes the application.
* Norton Privacy Control - Can prevent you from inadvertently disclosing personal information in email/chat etc. All confidential information needs to be input manually though.
* Nicely integrates with your system, and does not needlessly interfere with applications. I've had no known application issues due to the installation of NIS 2003/2004.
* Norton AntiSpam - New features in NIS 2004. It integrates nicely with Outlook 2003 and Outlook Express. It's been quite a useful feature, and would be worth the upgrade/purchase for many users. Seems to remove about 70-80% of my spam, and seems to flag about 10-20% of my legitimate email as spam. Very user-friendly feature, and learns from your input on what's spam and not spam.
* LiveUpdate - Works great and can be configured to seamlessly update your computer against the latest threats. Works fine with modem as well - does not try to dial up all the time, but rather checks for updates when you're already online.
CONS:
* PRODUCT ACTIVATION - Almost made me not upgrade. TWO THUMBS DOWN! Personally, I don't care if the product activation is flawless, I'm very unhappy with Norton treating their legitimate customers with such great distrust.
* Needs more tweaking than I'd like to get up and running - at least for the firewall/intrusion detection bit.
* Memory/CPU and resource hog - It does slow down your system noticeably, but I'd rather have that happen than having my computer screwed up by a virus/Trojan/hacker.
PROBLEMS?
* One thing I've noticed is that a few occasions it has alerted about an intrusion attempt from my own computer. This hasn't seemed to cause any problems though.
* The automatic program scan, which is supposed to find all known software and configure the firewall/intrusion detection for each of them crashed during installation. I've not been able to successfully run this, so therefore I've had to configure each program manually as they tried to access the internet.
Overall, I'm quite pleased with NIS 2004. For me it was also worth the upgrade from NIS 2003. They could definitely improve on the performance itself, and they should remove product activation (aka. ""We hate our legitimate users, so we'll make life difficult for them""). 4 STARS!!!",Works well - slows down your computer,False,1071792000,2.079441541679836,1.0

"First the rant:  My not-very-old laptop developed several problems simultaneously, and I decided to just buy a new one, assuming I could move my Office Pro 2010 to the new machine.  Unfortunately, Microsoft said ""no""!  Turns out it was licensed for only one computer and they did not care if your computer crashed the next day after you bought it.  Your bad luck.  I see that they have backed down on that - the description for the new software says you may move it from one computer to another.

I made do with the Word and Excel starter on the new laptop, but Publisher is my go-to software, and it really galled me to have to buy it.  I even looked for other software to replace it but couldn't find anything that would convert my old files.

So, now for the review:  It took about 1.5 hours to download (I have a fairly slow connection) and only a few minutes to install.  It looks quite different from 2010, but so far using it has been fairly intuitive.  There are some changes in how it operates, but I like the ones that I have encountered.  For the most part the changes I have seen correct awkward steps.  For example, when you click in a text box there is a new menu Text Box Tools menu that you can access with many of the functions that used to be hidden several levels down in various menus.

In all fairness, I have not yet done any graphics-heavy publications.  If I encounter problems as described by some of the reviewers I will amend this review.

Although they make improvements every year, very few of them are of any interest to me, and if it weren't for the download restrictions, I would probably buy a new version every 10 years, instead of three.

It's important to be aware of the learning curve associated with this product. I have a background in accounting and I've informally helped many people get started. It takes quite a few hours for a new user with no financial or accounting background to get comfortable with all the functions in the program they need to perform. This usually entails a significant cleanup operation after a couple of months of entering transactions incorrectly. Once the learning process is complete, however, QuickBooks vastly simplifies the process of running a small business.","Big learning curve, must buy latest edition every three years",True,1448236800,2.3978952727983707,0.0

"Item: Cyberlink PowerDVD 14 Ultra, Rating 4.5 stars.
I really enjoy this software for playing files. I've used older versions without problems. I've also used WinDVD versions as well, and like that program too. I use more of Cyberlink's other programs like Power2Go and Director.

Install process: The install is straightforward and only took 5 minutes. After install, enter the product key, then you need an internet connection for the product activation which took 3 seconds.  First, on the Welcome Screen, click on Media Library Preference. In the Movie Library, delete or add folders you want to connect with PowerDVD. It will sync those
folders with the software. Do that for Movies, the Videos/Photos tab, and Music tab.

Next screen is the Cyberlink Cloud Service. Redeem you free one year now or later. You can upload your content from your smartphone to the cloud to be accessed later on by your other devices.

After setup was complete, I ran the updates, and that was a fairly quick process. Interface: It's a very clean and organized interface. You can drag files into the player and it will begin playing them. It's a fast program and processes everything quickly. I'm running a AMD Quad-Core processor 64-bit, with 8GB RAM, and a 1GB ATI video card. You can also create playlists of various files. I noticed that the software had automatically associated certain files with the software. While I prefer using other programs. You can change the program back by right-clicking a file and selecting ""Choose default program"" and then select the program and make sure ""Always use this as default program"" is checked. There are instructions online to change programs associated with files. This should never have been done. I'm subtracting 1/2 a star for it. But since I'm experienced with this stuff it doesn't bother me much. Others may be annoyed.

In creating PowerDVD 14 Ultra, Cyberlink knew they had to bring a much morepromising experience to PC users.  This whole package was created to be a seamless and easy to share experience.  You can easily share to Facebook, Flickr, YouTube, or Vimeo. For those who like using Vimeo forvideo-sharing, Vimeo support has also been added in this version.  I own version 11 as well, and had no issues with that version. Version 14 proves to run without problems for me. They've added support for
the new HEVC/H.265 format with this version.

Using a blu-ray optical drive, this software plays DVDs, Blu-rays, 3D Blu-rays and4K Blu-rays.  The software can also view 3D photos and videos.  BD Live is alsosupported. I tried all the types of optical discs mentioned above, and they all
played without any problem. I had to use a different computer and TV to try out the 4k discs. 4K, 3D, and 60fps discs and files require much more processing power and I had to use a 2GB video card and a much better processor.  Everthing ran smoothly.
You can also play AVCHD, MP4, MKV, and M2TS files. A tried all different files mentioned above and they all played properly.

The Ultra version includes PowerDVD Remote v2, and Power Media Player (for Android/iOS and also Windows). PowerDVD Remote requires you to install an app on or iOS or Android device, and then you can use that as a remote control, or a
wireless mouse pad and keyboard for PowerDVD.  The app works well for me on my iPhone.

CLOUD: Included with the software is a free one-year subscription of 10GB to Cyberlink's Cloud service. Price after is $10 per every 10GB of storage. You can upload your files to their cloud service and access them anywhere. The cloud
service works fast on a fast connection, but remember it depends on how fast your connection is.

Normally, I use my big-screen LCD TV, PS3 blu-ray payer, and 7.1 speaker setup for my optical disc movie-watching needs. Since I can connect my PCs to my medium-size monitor or my big-screen TV, I'm available to view all my other files that aren't on optical discs.

INCLUDED: Also included are trial versions of other Cyberlink products: PhotoDirector 5, PowerDirector 12, DirectorSuite 2, Power2Go 9, YouCam 6, and MediaEspresso 6.7. Some of them I've used before and they are really good.","Great program for viewing optical discs and files, clean interface",False,1403654400,0.0,1.0

"Downloaded KIS7 because previous subscription was expiring. During load it said to remove old K product first (why didn't the installation program remove it?) After tedious and time consuming process it finally loaded. Then it said database is obsolete (over one year old).  Why didn't it download the current database? When I clicked the button to update, it said the site could not be found.  The product shut off all access to the network (Internet, email, LAN).  I disabled all the protection, still no access to the net.

Then I tried to remove the program; it wouldn't let me! Other programs on my computer ran, but KIS7 wouldn't let itself be removed (isn't that what a virus does?). Then I tried to restart. KIS wouldn't let me restart!  At the risk of really screwing things up, I had no alternative but to cut power! I crossed my fingers that my computer still ran. Low and behold, KIS7 was gone, and I had access to the net.  But now I don't have any anti-virus protection!

Apparently ""customer service"" is best found on K's forum. The ""expert"" said not to use the standard MS removal program, but to use K's special program (why didn't the download instructions say that?). Then he said to create a ""GSI log"" which requires a tool from...the internet. But wait...KIS7 prevents me from having internet access!!!

What a nightmare! A day later, I am far worse off than I was yesterday at this time.  I use my computer for work, not to troubleshoot someone's lousy software! I thought I was being proactive by renewing two weeks early. Not sure what to do now except find an AVS that works and try to get a refund from K or the credit card company.

Moral of the story: I should have read the Amazon reviews rather than rely on magazine reviews!

7/29/08 UPDATE:  ""Customer Service"" was unable to solve the problem. They finally offered a copy of KIS 2009 or a refund.  I wasn't about to shoot myself in the other foot and try 2009, and I needed antivirus protection, so after days of troubleshooting on my own I was able to install KIS7 (I'm not about to release the details - why should I help Kaspersky? They need to fix their product.).

It runs ok; startup is faster than Norton but slower than KAV6, but IE is MUCH slower. Even after a complete scan and 5 years of virus free operation, the ""Proactive Defense"" (which runs continuously) generated 650MB of reports in 4 hours!!! Besides eating up memory quickly, it definitly slow things down.  My computer ran fine (and faster) before using it (PD), what's the point now?

Originally I was looking at the Pinnacle DVD Recorder (that doesn't include the Pinnacle 12 software. Fortunately I got lucky and found this on sale at Best Buy for less than the Pinnacle DVD Recorder.

The quality for a documentary is good, not great (but then the VHS tape it's transferring from is good, not great).

Video processing is time intensive and it's going to take you a while... it's certainly not like ripping mp3s... LOL...

"I was unable to find  information on boot camp encryption in the Parallels user guide or knowledge base, so before I purchased the software, I called Parallels customer service. A sales or tech rep told me I could encrypt the Windows boot camp partition, so I ordered the software from Amazon. Sunday I installed Parallels Desktop 10 on my Macbook Pro 2014 boot camp partitioned for Windows 8.1 and Yosemite. Parallels installed easily and worked as expected until I tried to encrypt Windows boot camp and the virtual machine. I received the following error message: ""Encryption settings could not be applied. The virtual machine uses a physical hard disk.""

There are two choices for a Windows install from a boot camp partition: Windows using the boot camp partition, which makes changes in both the virtual machine and the boot camp partition and Windows using only a virtual machine, which means Windows is imported and installed on your Mac and there are no changes to the boot camp partition. There are four things listed that you cannot do when using the Windows boot camp partition to run Parallels. The inability to use encryption is not one of them.

After finding out I could not encrypt Windows boot camp, I called Parallels tech support early Monday morning. The technician I spoke with was difficult for me to understand, but he said the answer was yes, you could encrypt your boot camp partition, and he would send me information to solve the problem. The email I received from him at the end of the day resolving my problem had nothing to do with what I wanted to know. This morning, Wednesday, I finally received an answer from the fifth tech support person I either called or who responded to my email: Sorry, no, you cannot encrypt the Windows partition using Parallels. His email response was the only timely one, answering email I sent last night.

My advice: Use the trial version before paying for the licensing key, which is what you are buying from Amazon. The Parallels kb says you download the same program either way and only need a license to continue using it after 14 days.

"First the good news.  I've been using Acronis True Image for several years.  It has saved me more than once, so I was predisposed to like the product.  They recently told me that there was an update.. it was cheap.. and they offered additional licenses for free.  How could I resist?

Well.. in retrospect, I wouldn't have done it.  The new user interface is confusing.  In fairness, it might just be that it is ""different"", but I find it hard to use.  Second, it's a dog.  It seems like I spend a lot of time looking at frozen screens with a ""(Not responding)"" message in the title bar.  I don't recall having that problem with previous versions.  I like to start a backup image running as I leave the office for lunch or a meeting.  It used to be easy to do that.  Now it freezes/pauses in the midst of a lot of questions that it asks you, so I can't just start it and walk away like I used to.  It does eventually start working, but it's a frustrating process.  I also seem to remember that it used to keep my ThinkPad alive when running.  Now, I come back and find that my laptop has gone to sleep and the backup has locked up.  That's probably something that I have to change in my power management settings, but I can't remember it ever being an issue before.

Finally, a number of reviewers have said that things just don't work - and that they get little sympathy from tech support.  I honestly haven't had that problem yet.. but I haven't had a catastrophic failure since I upgraded, so I haven't tried a full image restore.  Makes me nervous!

I think they must have run into the classic ""QuickBooks/Quicken dilemma"".  They produced an inexpensive well functioning product, and then realized that they had no revenue stream, since there was no compelling reason to ever upgrade.  So they mess around with the user interface every year to get you to think that it's ""better"".  If you have the 2010 version, I'd advise you to skip this one.  Maybe they'll work out the problems in the 2012 version... It just doesn't seem to work as well as the version I replaced.  It's still inexpensive, but I can't see any justification for spending even the modest price of the upgrade.

*******************  FOLLOWUP COMMENTS (3/12/11)************* *************************************************************
Something is just not right here.  I've been using True Image Home for years, and until the 2011 version, would have given it 5 stars.

I upgraded to 2011 and nothing has been the same since.  My first problem was that it was painfully slow.  I'd get screens with a ""not responding"" message.  I posted an unflattering review here, citing that problem, and I got a response from a tech named ""Yana"".  Yana told me that there was an unreleased new build available. I downloaded it and, sure enough, it resolved the ""not responding"" issue.

Unfortunately, it introduced another problem.  I always do FULL backups.  With the new build, EVERY time I do a backup and then try to shut down the computer, I'm held hostage for 20-30 minutes with a ""Operations are in progress"" message, which prevents an orderly shutdown.  This happens even if I do the shutdown hours after the backup has completed.  Once it has completed whatever the heck it is doing, I'm all set until I try to do another backup.

Yana corresponded with me for a while and suggested that I download their Schedule Manager.  When you run this, it takes you to a command prompt, which allows you to ""ZAP"" all scheduled tasks.  I can't see any scheduled tasks and did not intentionally create any.  Doing this does eliminate the shutdown issue, but I sometimes forget, and it's a real pain. Yana suggested that there might be some kind of corrupt driver issue, and then simply disappeared.  I've tried over several weeks to reestablish communication, but can't get any kind of response from Yana.

I submitted additional support requests and have been contacted by other techs.  They are friendly and polite in that perfunctory/boilerplate ""your call is very important to us.. sorry for the inconvenience ..."" way, but neither has been able to explain to me what is going on or how to stop it.  One again suggested corrupt drivers and had me download a fix.  That didn't work and then that tech disappeared.  Another support request and another tech... this one tells me that this is the way the program is supposed to work.

I Googled the issue and find that a lot of people have the problem.  I never had it before.  I don't understand it.  I don't like it, and I can't find a way to turn it off.  I take my laptop with me to client sites, so it's on and off several times a day.  I can't wait 1/2 hour for the machine to shut down.

I'll typically start a backup when I'm leaving the office for a while without the machine.  I expect the machine to be functional when I return.  So far, I've found two workarounds.  One approach is to do the scheduler ""ZAP"".  The other is to set the backup so that it shuts the machine down afterwards.  The downside of approach #2 is that I have to make sure I allow for the additional 1/2 hour for the ""operations in progress"" thing to complete.  The other problem is that the machine is off when I return, so I have to restart it.  Not a huge deal, but why do I have to put up with this hassle?

Bottom line advice.  If you have a previous version of True Image that is working for you, DO NOT UPGRADE!!!  I'd even be suspicious about downloading an update for your version.  Maybe they will explain it eventually.  Maybe they will even fix it.  Until then, stay far far away from this version.",Disappointing upgrade- Part II - Down to One Star,False,1294876800,3.555348061489413,0.0

"This review is for Movies on CD and DVD 2005, but since it is mostly about their tech support, I think it is relevant.

My experience with Magix products as well as their technical support has been bad and I recommend avoiding them at all costs if you want to save yourself the trouble I went through.

Last year I purchased Magix's Movies on CD and DVD in hope of using it to transfer my Hi8 tapes to DVDs. I was able to capture movies and edit scenes, but the product didn't work with my DVD burner. My emails to customer support have remained unanswered to this day. In the meantime they announced a new version of the product, Movies on CD and DVD 2005, so I decided to wait for it to come out, as their user interface and features seemed ok for what I needed.

The new  version finally came out in the fall of 2004 and I bought it. I tried to capture my movies then burn them on DVD. The capture went fine, and then I proceeded to automatic scene recognition. When I started the editing process I realized the preview and the cursor  position on the timeline or storyboard view were out of sync. This makes editing a movie difficult if not impossible. I tried to recapture the movie, change settings etc, but nothing helped. I then decided to contact tech support.

I first sent them an email explaining the problem, but after 3 days I received a reply saying that I should use the tech support submission form on the website. I went there and ran their utility which captured all my system settings and I explained the problem again and submitted my request after which I received an email with a case number.

I didn't receive any reply for the next several days, so I decided to call them. A bored and annoyed guy answered and after I explained that I had sent several emails, he said that case numbers are actually not used and don't mean anything to them. After a short discussion, his answer to my problem was that (and I paraphrase) ""this is the first time I heard about this issue, so it must be something wrong with your computer"". Whenever I tried to bring up arguments showing that a bug in their software was a plausible possibility as well, he kept repeating the same mantra. Finally he asked me for my email address saying that he would send me an utility for gathering more info about my configuration, but I never received anything from him.

I then decided to ask for a refund so I called again. I was transferred to another person in tech support who sounded more like a manager, in the sense that he was not as belligerent as the other tech support person, and after he apologized for the problem I was experiencing, he said that he would ask the developers to look into the issue, but that he could not give me a refund. He also confirmed that case numbers are useless. I decided to give them one more chance, so at his request, I resent him the email with my configuration and description of the problem. I even offered to send them my video to see if they can reproduce the problem and issue a fix After several days without a sign from them, I sent a new email asking him to confirm that he received it, and also to let me know when I would get an answer. No reply.

I then decided to escalate the request and I sent an email to their public relations person in Germany where I explained again everything that happened. As you may have guessed, no reply this time either.

I am still waiting for them to reply or fix my problem.

"I've been using Paint Shop Pro since version 4, and have used PSP4 and PSP8 extensively.  I also have an older copy of Photoshop, version 7, which I use quite a bit.  A couple weeks ago, I downloaded the trial version of PSP X2 Ultimate.  As I became used to the interface, I found myself using Photoshop and the older versions of PSP less and less.  There are many things to like about X2 Ultimate, and relatively few annoyances.  I plan on purchasing a copy once the trial period runs out.

Most of my work with these products involves processing of images from my DSLR and scanning and processing slides and negatives.  I find X2 Ultimate much easier to use than Photoshop, and more convenient to use than PSP8.  Many of my old slides have taken on a magenta cast, which I find is more accurately removed by X2 Ultimate than by either PS7 or PSP8.  However, the primary tool that I use to correct the color cast -- ""Color Balance"" is not as easy to use as the same tool in PSP8.  It's been dumbed down and if additional refinements are needed, the controls left are not as effective as those used in PSP8.  I have found that X2 Ultimate does an admirable job at removing grain and/or noise from images, with several different tools that can be employed.  The High Pass sharpening feature is a welcome addition, and I find myself using it frequently.

X2 Ultimate does require more computer oomph, though.  I have it installed on an older system running XP with a 1.2 ghz processor and ""only"" 768MB RAM.  This is plenty of power for the other imaging software I use, even Photoshop, but X2 Ultimate definitely lags, swapping memory to and from the hard drive frequently.  I use a tablet for some editing chores.  X2 supports pen pressure for variable width lines (PSP8 does not, although PS7 does), but the drawn output does lag behind the cursor on my system, while the lag is negligible with either PSP8 or PS7.

The fact that X2 Ultimate will require that I either add RAM to my system, or upgrade it altogether for performance to improve is why I give this product 4 stars instead of 5.",Best PSP Yet,False,1235433600,2.8332133440562166,1.0

"I had the chance to test Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 at work and I was SOOOO surprized at how much improved the voice recognition had become.  Last time I gave Dragon a test was back when Dragon Naturally Speaking 10 Professional was brand new.  Dragon NaturallySpeaking has always been a solid product that worked well in all my experiences over the years but, Dragon NaturallySpeaking was always tempormental.  I have cerebral palsy so modulating my voice came hard hence I always found more troube than it was worth using for dictation.

Well not to long ago I was asked at work to test Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 and WOW I was so shocked by its awesome performance that I nearly lost it.  Oh I expected a slight improvement with Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 because; with each version upgrade Dragon NaturallySpeaking always got better.  I always liked testing Dragon NaturallySpeaking but it was not until Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 that I actually ENJOYED using Dragon NaturallySpeaking for dictation.

Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 loads easily on Windows 7-32 bit systems provided you have ample RAM \ ROM Memory, Sound Card and CPU resources on a quality system.  Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 was never slow or lagged during my testing.  Matter of fact Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 is down right eager compared to any of the earlier Dragon versions.  Now all I had open was Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 and Word or Wordpad so the drain on computer resources was not great.  Surely if you use Dragon NaturallySpeaking in conjunction with many other resource intensive software programs or apps you might see degradation in Dragon NaturallySpeaking 12 performance.

I can't speak for versions other than Dragon NaturallySpeaking Professional 12 because; I have not used them.  I can say Dragon NaturallySpeaking Professional 12 is a total and complete winner, the best Dragon I ever used bar none.  With the right computer configuration and high quality USB microphone there is no beating Dragon NaturallySpeaking Professional 12.

"Microsoft has done it again! Outlook with Business Contact Manager 2007 is a very solid, simple, and intuitive small business platform to work from. I have been in sales for over 10 years and have used a variety of solutions, including ACT and I like Business Contact Manager the best so far. If you enjoy actually selling as opposed to updating information continually, this is the solution for you. For instance, ACT has many useless and cumbersome bells and whistles that require input of information multiple times in multiple screens. Microsoft left these out...thankfully. In fact, I spent more time updating information in ACT than actually using it to be productive. Act is also prone to databases corruption. Our data in ACT was corrupted at least 2-3 times in a year. ACT Synchronization is finicky at best. And ACT integration to accounting software is cumbersome and expensive. Microsoft has trimmed the fat and created a very streamlined platform that gets the job done. No corruption of data thus far. Accounting software integration is a breeze-I use Microsoft Accounting 2007-also a very solid small business solution if you don't need automated Payroll-a less expensive option to QuickBooks.  Only having to enter information once, simple customization, and seamless 2-way integration with accounting software is why I gave this a 5. It is not perfect but it is the best I have used thus far.

"First and foremost this DOES NOT allow a upgrade from Windows 7.  It does allow you to keep all your data but does wipe out your applications so if there is a program you can't live without and can't find the original disks you have a BIG decision to make.  I would suggest you put all self generated files, e.g., documents on an external drive and then disconnect the drive just in case.

Shortly after the installation the OS did a critical update so when I came back to my computer it was done.  Note:  I did an 8.0 to  8.1 upgrade on my Surface pro the day before as a downloaded upgrade.  The results were not stellar to say the least.  On the tablet I had to remove the update because it wiped out the wifi connection and I tried everything I knew to restore it.  Once I backed off the update it worked just fine.  On the desktop (New Dell that came native with 8 on it) I began getting error messages saying that my IE browser was an old version of Netscape and it was incompatible.  The solution I found was to install the newest version of Fire Fox which seems to fixed the problem.  It appears that some vendors are not as compatible as they thought they were and MS has some work to do.

So In my estimation 8.1:
1.  Has some bugs that need to be addressed
2.  Is faster than 7 was
3.  Has a smaller learning curve
4.  Has some compatibility issues

"This is the first item, in years of order from Amazon, that I have ever returned (the return process with Amazon, btw, is wonderful!).  The GPS with this software is very good, it gets a signal quickly, and is very accurate.  It does not (which is what led to my returning the item) however, work well with other software.  There's an application that you have to load to make the GPS appear in software like Steets & Trips (it converts the USB signal to a COM port) which is more hassle then I wanted to deal with.

The software, however, is HORRIBLE.  I can't express in words how bad this software is.  I work in IT for a living, and I work with many different software packages every day.  I spent about 16 hours working with the software, trying to learn how it ""did"" things, and working around it's issues.  I was trying to plan an upcoming trip to Yellowstone; none of the points of interest were hitting; I was entering GPS coordinates for the hotels I'm staying in, and the overall process (planning a single trip, 7 waypoints) took almost 4 hours.  It was just horribly complicated, and incredibly frustrating.  After going through that disaster, I decided to try a competing product, Streets and Trips 2009 (free download available).

Using S&T, I planned the entire trip in about 30 minutes.  EVERY single hotel I'm staying in was immediately picked up; the longest part of the process was figuring out how to tell the software that I was stopping in a location for the evening.  It was SO much better then this product's software that I purchased another GPS (Hulox M1000) and decided to send this one back.  I realized that, even if I did eventually learn the software, my co-pilot (girlfriend) would never figure it out, and she'd hate me forever for making her try.

This software is so poor it shouldn't even be sold; I've used alpha software that's more refined and easier to use.  The GPS is great, but if you want to use it with another product, you will HAVE to use the serial port emulator (a deal breaker for me), another piece of software to load on your mapping computer.

I realize that some people like the Street Atlas interface; but, trust me, if you've never used mapping software before, you will absolutely hate it; it reminds me of a DOS program that's been ported to Windows.","Good GPS, horrible software",True,1242086400,1.3862943611198906,0.0

"I've used CorelDRAW for many years - since version 3. I used it as a desktop publisher and a typesetter and to create architectural shop drawings. These days, I use it to create graphics that I can import into embroidery digitizing programs to create custom embroidery designs.

The reason it's so wonderful is that it created graphics in a vector-based format. Vector based graphics are different than, say, bitmaps because they are infinitely re-sizeable without any loss of resolution. Vector images are mathematical descriptions of the image, which is exactly the same at any size. Bitmaps, on the other hand, are composed of an exact number of pixels so they suffer greatly when sized up - jagged edges and loss of sharpness.

Corel offers an incredibly full-featured graphics suite so that almost anything you need to create, edit, or produce can be done comepletely within the product. It includes an extensive font library and stock images, artwork, backgrounds, symbols and template galleries that are spectacular for business applications as well as individual users.

The suite includes several programs - CorelDRAW x7, Capture x7, Power Trace x7, Photo-Paint x7, Connect x7, Website Creator and Bitstream Font Navigator. (You must download Website Creator from the Corel website after you install and register CorelDRAW x7 and set up an account. The account gives you access to updates and all sorts of extra help, tutorials, community discussions as well as other downloads.

Inside the box is the install disk and a quick reference card. (The registration key is located in the plastic disc case behind the disk.) Unlike early versions, there are no printed instruction manuals and font/clip art catalogs. Instead, the almost 700 page users guide is on Corel's site and can be downloaded to your computer. There are also over 5 hours of tutorial videos included with the program that allows even complete novices to begin using this software with confidence.

Installation went smoothly for me. Note: The EULA only allows you to have this software installed on one computer at any time.

Besides the software, there are 1,000, high-quality, OpenType fonts, 800 background patterns and frames, more than 10,000 pieces of clip art, 2000 stock digital photos, 2,000 vehicle templates and 350 templates.

"I'm updating from Windows XP, not so much because I really want to, but due to the dropped support for XP. Honestly, it was time. I backed up a few hundred GB of pictures, game files, emails, documents and music to an external drive before I ever started because I didn't want to take any chances. I deleted the three partitions of my hard drive and went for a fresh install in a single partition. The install time was remarkably fast compared to my previous experience with Win98, Win2K, and WinXP. I've done one Win7 install for a friend and I don't remember it being this fast either. Running on default drivers was a much better experience than XP as well. I updated video, audio and LAN drivers because of features my hardware offer, but I was running with network access as soon as Win8.1 was up.

The interface is different, but I knew it would be. I've had a few minor adjustments to make in my expectations but most of the features of the new interface are easily avoided and ignored once you figure them out. I know there has been much to do about the unified touch-screen-friendly look, but I really think that most of the negative response is over-wrought and undeserved. Most people have learned to use the interface on their phones and their tablets and most people are able adaptable enough to learn a few new tricks.

"Having been (and still am) a DIY enthusiast for decades, I began using Broderbund's Interior Design software way back in 1995, loved it, and a couple of years later I came across Punch design software. It did an admirable job, and I continued with their software up until my very recent download of Chief Architect Suite 2014. (As an aside, I also want to state here that I have used AutoCad/Mechanical Desktop for mechanical engineering design work for years too, but obviously that software could only be used at work!)

Back to this product: It took a bit of getting used to in creating 3-D views (which reminded me of the Broderbund product in that regard). However, my biggest problem was that I was unable to get 90% of the textures to SHOW in my 3-D rendered views. I browsed their forum, and noticed that many others were having the same ""white furniture/objects"" problem, and the blame went to ""graphics card problem"". I wrote to the company and they suggested a refund. I ""sat on it"" for a day or so, and went back on in to the program. I did NOT want to give it up as I ""liked it too much"".

The reason for my review's title of five stars and the refund comment is this: I SOLVED the ""white furniture/object"" problem quite accidentally. I was using the render option to view my finished room layout, and noticed in the drop down menu the last option to 'toggle textures'. Hmm, I wonder... and YES, *that* was my problem all along. I kick myself for not having seen it sooner, as I wasted hours of frustrated tinkering - wavering from ""get a refund"" to ""I wish it would work"". Sigh.

I wanted it to work because what I ""could"" see of the rendering in 3-D was superb - baseboards and crown moldings, EXCELLENT cabinet placement, whereby corner cabinet counter tops ""automagically"" fill in the missing space when two corner cabinets are properly aligned either side by side or angled - and the counter top is still editable for a different choice of granite, or say, marble (and the cabinets color/material can be changed too).

Another very nice feature (over Punch) is when you do a door cut-out - i.e. a ""doorway"" with no casing. The baseboard ACTUALLY WRAPS around the wall's thickness. In Punch, there's nothing there to cover the wall's thickness... just sharp cut-off baseboard edges at the back and the front of the wall... so KUDOS to Chief Architect for giving me properly wrapped baseboards!

Also, I love the accuracy of the wall's thicknesses - and choices - anywhere from standard 2x4 studs, to 2x6 - all the way to CBS or poured concrete walls! WOW!

I also like the choice of ""style"" when you first start a new plan. I have used ""cottage"" theme, and ""traditional"" already. In both cases, the doors and baseboards are styled to fit the theme. Cottage gave me bead board cabinets and such, painted in white. In Traditional, the doors were of dark wood. Why is this good? Back in my Punch days, the baseboards and doors and windows were always of a light wood, and if you wanted them to be painted white, you had to painstakingly select them and add the styling. That's not to say you can't or won't change the colors of window frames/doors etc in your chosen theme using this software, but it's very handy when baseboards/crown/window frames are already the color you want! I spend too much time using these programs as it is (ask my husband!!! he says it's a sickness with me) - so any time I can save NOT having to do tedious painting of baseboards throughout, is just FINE with me!

Their texture/color library is excellent too (plus you can download ""brand name"" furniture groupings and the like, for free. (Some you have to pay for IF you have a more expensive version of this software). I actually can put LEATHER on my couches now! And there's an abundance of different types of glass: block, stained, opaque, clear - for instance. I also love the smoothness of their rendered bathtubs! The Punch version was awful compared to this software (but then again, I'm running this on a brand new Win8 PC with upgraded memory etc. but with the standard video card).

The program seems to be smart enough to know that when you paint one wall a certain color, you don't have to fiddle around ""breaking"" a long (interior or exterior) wall, so that you can have different wall colors and/or tile/textures in rooms on either side of the perpendicular wall.

Another reason I chose this software was due to my having a newly purchased Win8 PC, as mentioned. Also - THE PRICE of this software is unbeatable.

There's much much much more about this program that I like, but right now this review is turning into a book. Sorry about that. If you've never used house design software before, I hope my review will help you in your purchasing decision. I won't say it's been the easiest to learn (as many other reviewers have stated) but then again, neither was Mechanical Desktop a walk in the park either, learning-wise!

As another reviewer stated, it's GREAT for furniture arranging -  no more aching backs ""seeing if something looks right"" and then changing your mind... do it on the PC screen first, then call in your buddies for a furniture-moving party!

If you're as bad as me, (some 400+ plans created over the past 17 years) then I highly recommend using this product to get those designs out of your head and into 3-D form.

"We purchased ""JumpStart Kindergarten"" for our son about 8 months ago. It was a solid product from which he enjoyed learning. This new ""Advanced"" version is even better than the original!
Game layout is improved, as are the animated characters. Whereas the original featured mostly ""Hopsalot,"" the Advanced version features more of the JumpStart characters (six in total). The incentive for learners to keep playing (outside of the fact that the learning activities really are FUN!) is the chance to ""build"" a customized bumper car and enter a contest to collect the most special objects.
Features include the progress report, and a new and neat assessment test. First-time users take the assessment test, and have the option of letting the computer set the difficulty level for the learning activities, or they are allowed to set them manually.
Like other JumpStart titles, users enter a treehouse which serves as a schoolhouse. Inside the treehouse, there are three characters (learning stations), each focusing on a different subject (reading, music, and art). When exiting the treehouse to the back of the school, users meet three other characters (learning stations): spelling and phonics, addition and subtraction, and patterns and sizes.
Users click on a character to enter that particular learning area. Successful answers are counted and tracked by character-specific objects (bows, bubbles, flags, musical note, etc.). After collecting 4 of the objects, a carrot is awarded and tracked with the on-screen bushel basket. After earning 10 carrots, users ""soup-up"" their bumper cars, and ""unlock"" a new competition area. In the competition area, users compete against the computer, or another player, and try to collect the most track-specific objects (candy, sea shells, etc.). The user collecting the most gets his/her ""picture"" in the ""newspaper.""

SUN provides a trial version of Staroffice 8. It's always a good idea to try something before you buy it, especially if you are new to it. Sun also sells a downloadable version of StarOffice 8 at $69.99.

If you are a student or a teacher, you can download StarOffice 8 for free from SUN's education software programm. Actually that's how I get my StarOffice since version 5.2.

StarOffice 8 is based on OpenOffice 2 with a little bit more features, including more fonts, more clip art and 60 days of free support. If those are not important to you, you might just want to download OpenOffice 2.0 since it's totally free.

Here is my experience of using StarOffice.

1. There are many non-Microsoft office softwares, none of them is 100% compatible with Microsoft Office. But the compatibility is more than enough for home users who do not heavily use Macro or scripts. I use StarOffice at home, Microsoft Office at school, I don't have any serious problem to use one to open files created by another.

2. SUN does not provide a full user manual for the downloadable version when I wrote this review though a simple getting-start guide is available at their website, I don't know if it's included in the retail package. That's too bad for new buyers since the features and functions can easily overwhelm anybody. But if you used StarOffice in the past, you should have no problem. I still use the manual of version 7 for version 8 since most of it does not change much. The manual for OpenOffice 2.0 applies for StarOffice 8 too. I just downloaded the manual. It's still in draft version, but looks pretty much complete.

The suite is a set of programs - primarily a ""draw"" program for creating object graphics and doing page design, and a ""paint"" program for photo and similar editing.  In addition, you get a variety of other, more specific programs (a tracing program, a capture program, etc), a clip art library, and a font library.

I think this package would be great for photo editing, poster or brocure layout, and art projects.  It's relatively easy to learn, and runs on my 4 year old windows 7 computer.

"Maybe I am naive but I had assumed these images were in a usable format. Instead, you have to export them, one by one, via a cumbersome 5-step process which is quite pointless and only serves to slow you down. This is not particularly useful to a designer. I just wanted some clip art. Now I see why they charge so little -- they cripple you!

Also I concur that the images are not nearly as good a quality as Hemera would have you believe. All in all, though I love the quantity of images, the quality (and usability) is deeply lacking. Oh, and little would you guess, but if you want more than one computer to be able to use this library (i.e. over a network) you have to call them for a bulk license. Come on!

"I was very excited to have a chance to try this software; I've been using photo manipulating software that's at least ten years old and this promised to do new, exciting things. I found that some aspects of it were great, others I was disappointed with.

On the up side, the interface is very easy to use. Every button has a label (you have to hover to see it) and each process has instructions right there on the screen, no need to keep `help' open. This is great, because the program is set up very differently from PhotoImpact or PhotoShop. It has a set of tools exclusively for shots of people- which is probably the most popular use of photo programs. It has the usual red eye, but also a tooth whitener, a wrinkle remover & skin smoother, and an `eye blinger' (Really? Really? That's the best name you could come up with?) that brightens the whites of eyeballs and darkens lashes. It has a one step tool for making a photo black & white, sepia or color tinted. What I love about this tool is that you can then take a brush and brush items back into their original colors without having to make a mask. This can create some dynamite flower and jewelry photos! The program also contains a tool for removing unwanted items from photos easily- you draw around the object, then drag it over to a section you'd like to replace it with. The place you put it duplicates over the unwanted object. I do a lot of photos of plants and flowers for articles, and there always seems to be an electric line, weed, old step ladder or something in the photo and this is much easier for dealing with that than PhotoImpact is. Despite having these super easy tools, it also has ones that are a little more `pro', like histogram, masks, white balance, HSL/color etc. There are downloadable extras available, as well as updates for the program. It's also a great way to sort and label photos. You can put multiple tags on a photo- a person's name, the location it was shot, the date, whatever- and then use those tags to sort in different ways. It turns your photo collection into a searchable database!

On the down side, since it's a new release I was hoping it would be able to work with some newer file formats. It only handles RAW, JPEG and TIFF, not GIF or PNG. I also wish it had a good feature for adding text- the only way you can add text is to put it into a watermark template.

I can't comment on speed; it's supposed to need a processor that runs at 3.0 GHz and I loaded it onto my laptop that runs at 2.2 GHz. It runs slowly, but not to the point of driving me nuts. Because of the way it works on my computer, I suspect on a 3.0 it would be blazing.

It's an easy, decent photo app and I'll be using it a lot, but I'll also be keeping PhotoImpact for things like text, fancy frames, textures, lenses and artistic effects. For a person who is mainly using it for family photos and event photos, it's really all they'd need.",Super easy program to use,False,1353801600,2.079441541679836,1.0
"I'm almost finished with this program and I can truly say that it has exceeded my expectations. I am now on lesson 29 of the 30 lessons. Lesson 29 covers reflexive verbs and reflexive pronouns. Unless you're a complete newbie to learning Spanish, then you already know that reflexive verbs is one of the most difficult areas of Spanish for native English speakers to learn. The way that other Spanish programs taught the topic of reflexive verbs only drove me crazy.

The instructor in this lesson does an awesome job of teaching this topic. And I now feel that I finally have a solid grasp on the topic. My only complaint about lesson 29 is that the instructor seems to be lecturing a lot more in this lesson, compared to all of the other 29 lessons where there was very little lecturing but lots of drills and exercises. But I guess it was necessary to do a lot of explaining in this lesson so that native English speakers really understand how reflexive verbs function in Spanish.

All of the lessons have a feature that allow you to ""hide"" the text and just here the audio. I recommend that you hide the text. Hiding the text or only looking at it when I want to know how a word is spelled has really helped me to understand spoken Spanish. I'm sure that it has also helped my Spanish pronunciation.

Another tip that I have to help you get the most out of this software is to take advantage of its feature that allows you to add the mp3 audio files to your iPhone or android phone. That way you can learn Spanish while you are doing some other activity. I use the software on my laptop at home and when I have somewhere to drive I listen to the program in my car.","Spanish reflexive verbs demystified, finally!",False,1454976000,1.0986122886681098,1.0

"I've been online since the 1990's and have always been security conscious. I've been using Norton since it came pre-installed on my first PC. Later I added Spybot Search & Destroy and Zone Alarm.  Keeping them co-existing in peace has required some tweaking over time, but all was well until a couple of months ago when I updated Zone Alarm.  My fast pc slowed down and start-up took forever. I tried all sorts of fixes and nothing worked.  I decided I had to find one security suite that could handle most issues.  After researching lots of sources I decided to go with Trend Micro Internet Security 2008.  My install went flawlessly and I've been extremely pleased with the ease of use and unobtrusive nature of this software.

Here's a play-by-play version of what I did: first, I defragmented my hard drive; next I uninstalled Spybot (in the uninstall help file they even tell you which file you need to manually remove and where to find it!); after that I uninstalled Zone Alarm; and finally, the real pain, I uninstalled Norton System Works.  This has to be done carefully and involves a number of different steps.  (Norton has an uninstaller online, but I've had a problem with that in that past.)  You must do the uninstall in the proper order and be certain that you do all the separate parts ie the automatic updater.  Also, Norton files are hidden all through the computer so they have to be searched out and deleted manually.  When that was done, I defragmented my hard drive again.  My final step was inserting the Trend Micro CD, re-enabling my internet connection when it became mandatory, updating the software and running a scan.

It took a long time to do the above, but I think it's a good way to install any new security software.  I think some of the problems people have had with Trend Micro might be related to not starting off as ""clean"" as possible.

It organizes the content two different ways: by date and by the web site of origin.  For most people, this is more detail than they want or need and Cleansweep's cleanup utility is fine.

"I have to say that by and large, Vista is better.  Excel 2007 is absolutely horrible to me, though.  I've used Excel XP a LOT, and am very familiar with it.  The transparent interface and flexibility with its functions and Macros is unparalleled by anything this side of Matlab or Mathematica, plus you can do so many every-day things too.

With Excel 2007, Microsoft seems to be trying to appeal to the stupid among the masses who are impressed with eye candy, and ease and simplicity of easy and simple tasks, so they've dumbed down the functionality and constrained many of their functions that were previously general and flexible so as to be only for one clearly defined product bullet point.  For instance: in Excel XP you used to be able to use conditional formatting on almost anything such as making the text color grey if the value is equal to that of the cell above, now you can pretty much only use conditional formatting in limited ways on numbers alone.  Almost any time I've tried to do anything with Excel 2007 beyond just data entry, it took at least 10 times longer than it would in XP, trying to figure out how to modify their designer's vision of what all spreadsheets should be like into what I want, or how to interpret their much to colloquially worded dialog boxes, ultimately having to resort to agonizing trial-and-error for something they should just state plainly.  The most consistently annoying thing for me (and this is just one example of many similar things) is that the combination of Ctrl+Shift+Down (and Up) doesn't do a **** thing anymore - they haven't put it to use, not even on something I wouldn't but others would use, it just does absolutely nothing!  Ctrl+Shift+Left and Ctrl+Shift+Right still work, but not Up or Down! (Ctrl+Shift+Down used to select every cell starting at the current cell and going down until it either encountered a blank cell or stopped encountering non-empty cells - similar controls exist in all Microsoft software)  I would and could write a Macro to do this that runs off the Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down shortcut and it's really not too difficult, but then you can't undo afterword, as you can't with any Macros in Office products.

Basically, if you have any significant geeky or right-brain leanings, or if you've grown very comfortable with past versions of Excel, you will almost certainly be frustrated with this and find yourself trying to get Pre-Vista Excel installed on your Vista computer.

"I purchased these maps for a driving trip through Switzerland, Austria, Germany and Italy. On the whole the maps themselves were excellent, finding the smallest roads, alleys etc. I purchased the CD as opposed to the SD card after reading reviews stating the card cannot be updated and some route planning software had to be purchased separately that was on the CD.
Here's where I got into trouble, As many reviewers stated assembling and downloading the regions to your unit is not very intuitive and pretty cumbersome (I'm trying not to stay stupid). Being that I had an extra 1 gig SD card around I only wanted to download the portions of Europe I needed. I made a route for my trip and made waypoints (hotels airports, sites I wanted to see etc) I zoomed in on the area of Europe for my trip. I highlighted all the oddly shaped regions that crossed borders, included portions of the Mediterranean etc, and downloaded them to my GPS. I cross checked the whole thing once downloaded. I simulated take me from point A to point B on my trip. GPS said calculating and let's go. Wonderful I thought that wasn't bad at all.
Upon arrival all worked well until I entered Zurich and Milan. As I approached, detail would start to disappear, and then side roads, then the representation of the car on the GPS would be in a void next to the one or two roads still on the screen that didn't seem to really exist. The GPS would keep repeating ""Drive to highlighted route"". This happened to me both times we were in Zurich and Milan. We finally had to resort to good old maps. After leaving the area the GPS would slowly regain its brain.
Back in the US I called Garmin tech support. They told me that they had never heard of anything like it and offered to replace my unit. After much trial and error, back home I figured it out. When I selected the regions I was going to, my zoom level on the map was to low and the tiny tiny city regions of Zurich and Milan could not be seen and I could not tell they were not highlighted. They appeared to be part of the much bigger geographical regions surrounding them.
I know technically this was my doing, but who would have thought I need to select the black dots that were Zurich and Milan. With all this being said, My GPS never gave me an error stating part of my route was missing I was driving through, during creation or during the actual driving. It just said calculating 100 % and GO. No errors, it just started to loose its mind like the HAL9000 computer when Dave Poole started pulling out the memory ( Daisy Daisy how does your garden grooooooowwwww[...])

"First of all there is no good AVCHD video editing product available. So if you want an easy, fast, simple and LOGICAL program to put your AVCHD on a blue ray disk - Good Luck !!

That being said. This program does not work. I did all the updates and patches. I spent over 25+ hours (not including burning) trying to make it work. Did I say it doesn't work? It would take over 8 hrs to attempt to burn a blue ray. Every time it crashed before completing. (and it's not my computer). So I wasted 2 disks. Worst still it doesn't tell you why it crashed. Just a simple ""did not complete"" pop up tab.

Ok. So what do you do? I make simple blue ray burns with the Pinnacle Studio 12 software. Granted NONE of the fancy add on stuff works. No menus no nothing. But it doesn't waste expensive blue ray disks and it does allow you to burn without issue. Just keep it simple and don't expect (or better yet don't even attempt) anything fancy.

So we wait. There is a reason why I tried this program. I wanted it to work. I wanted to make AVCHD video's in blue ray just like my old dvd's. It's just not time yet.

Also - one more thing - the 'easy burn' option - doesn't work. It doesn't even make sense. There is no 'save' feature. So you do your whole set up in one shot (risking an hour or more with each attempt). But it is worthless.

"My job requires that I make heavy usage of a PC and related software.  But personally, I like the design of a Mac more.  Fusion has been a terrific tool for helping me to get the best of both worlds.  In general:

* If you really need windows and don't really need the Mac OS: Then I would stick with a PC.  Only because the Mac has taken a number of shortcuts with their keyboard that will drive you crazy.  Fusion is helpful, but it doesn't replace these shortcomings of a Mac.

* If your primary OS is PC, but you like to use the Mac sometimes.  Then Fusion may be the answer for you.  In general, I would still say you'll be happier with a PC because of the above reasons.

* If your primary OS is a Mac, but you occasionally have to make use of the PC OS.  Then Fusion is definately the answer for you.  Our company supports Microsoft CRM, so our users have to use the PC OS, Internet Explorer 7+ and usually Outlook.  So they can't use just the Mac OS.  But many of our clients use the Mac OS in their environment.

"An initial caveat: I am comparing this to QB Pro 2011 PC, which was the previous version of QB that  we had been using.

I installed the program on our Mac that had already been upgraded to the El Capitan operating system.  I had no difficulties with the installation.  I had been previously using QB 2011 via Parallel, and it took a couple of tries to get a working version of a backup that I could then open up in the Mac 2016. Once I did, all of my previous data did transfer over with the exception of my customized forms.

Mac 2016 looks nearly identical to  the  Pro 2011 for PC version, so I can't really comment on what may be lacking over previous PC versions.  The only thing I find difficult to use is the attachment feature, which was not an option with the earlier PC version.  I would have hoped that in the 5 years since I last purchased the software, they would have realized that Mac users are serious business owners, too. It would be nice to have the option to have the different versions of the software like the PC world does so I don't have to manually create all the different forms and categories.

My one major complaint with the software, and part of the reason for my 4 star rather than 5 star review (along with the lack of different versions for different business types and limited customer service options when you do run in to a problem), is the constant reminders that Intuit also sells additional services such as payroll and credit card processing...Thank you very much, Intuit. With those outrageous fees and constant reminders, I'll make sure you fall to the bottom of my list if I decide to add those features on at some point.

Update: After working with the software some more, I have finally figured out how to use the attachment feature (the problem was on my end and not QB's).  This is a great feature and upgrade from QB 2011 since I send out very detailed estimates and being able to attach those to the more basic estimate I generate in QB is going to save a lot of time down the road.  I do still miss some of the flexibility that came with QB Pro as far as reports and forms.  QB for Mac is geared more towards a product driven business vs a consulting or service type.  Hopefully that will be remedied in future versions.","Solid accounting software, just stop pushing additional pay features.",False,1446508800,4.634728988229637,1.0

During my early days as computer freshmen I try several tuneup utilities and some were not effective or not efficient, other would drain too much resources from the machine taking in account what they were doing and so on.

The only feature I don't like from AVG PC TuneUp is that gives me more notifications than I wish to receive.

"I bought Acronis True Image 8.0 because I have a new laptop from Dell who no longer ship the disks necessary for a complete rebuild of the operating system (instead, there is a Ghost image of the factory build on another partition ON THE SAME DISK). I needed a way of securing my operating system state against a variety of risks - worms, finger trouble, head crashes, regretted purchases of software, etc.

I suspect a lot of you are now in the same boat, especially if your investigations have led you here!

Acronis True Image is slap bang in the middle of the market niche resulting from Dell's new approach. For that reason it gets 5 stars. I used it to create a standalone bootable version of itself on CD (making 2 copies), after which I uninstalled it from my laptop (which I like to keep clean of unused software).

The standalone disk successfully backed up my hard drive to 7 CDs using the self same CD drive that I had booted Acronis standalone from. Subsequently I used it in the same way to rehearse my restore, with 100% success. I did all the partitions on the hard drive in the same operation. This is important if Dell PC Restore (Ctrl-F11) is to survive.

Q: WHY DOES IT GET SUCH A BAD PRESS ???

A: Because the design and implementation are absolutely appalling. This is not sloppiness, it is ignorance and naivety. I can go as far as to say that this product COULD HAVE COST ME UNTOLD CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS AND DAMAGE if I hadn't spent hours on the Internet searching for clues from other users' experiences. All because you don't know whether to believe this bloody message or not!!!

""Error opening file, a possible reason may be poor media quality.""

I got to the bottom of this - it is benign. It just means Acronis can't distinguish between hitting a bad patch on the CD and reaching the end. The error message author just wanted to err on the side of pessimism!

Note that on restore, I was asked to feed the disks in in a very strange order, suggesting the product runs through all the disks in the set, after which it returns for one last go at any that were dodgy. In fact, that was NOT what it was doing. The disks were all perfect. In my case, there were 3 partitions in the disk set. In order to restore a partition, Acronis seems to need to vist the first and then the last CD containing any part of the partition in question, before it will deign to restore the body of it.

Overall, this is the right product at the right time. Yes - you could have written it so much better yourself, but it does work, and introduces no clutter. Recall, I uninstalled it after creating my standalone CDs. Indeed it even enables you to dispense with other suppliers' clutter (I have also got rid of those space-hungry nannies Norton virus checker and Windows System Restore now that I have my preferred form of disaster recovery nailed down).",Sleeping With The Enemy,False,1128038400,2.302585092994046,1.0

I know ""high tech"" related companies frequently have the worst customer service/relations but Roxio, as far as I am concerned, really takes the prize for their exasperating ""Customer No Service"". I am beginning to wonder if it isn't Roxio corporate policy to be intentionally exasperating and screwed up so you won't [can't] bother them. Twice this last year have I been stiffed by this sorry company.

The first time was when I went to register their Easy CD Creator (Windows). Their website would not accept the serial number they gave me so I couldn't register therefore I couldn't download any Roxio software updates or even log in to there tech support forums or contact them in any way except telephone. The bad thing was later I when I tried to download virus software from another company, that installer said it detected a version of ""Easy CD Creator' that would cause problems with the the virus software and I should go and download the fix for Easy CD Creator before the virus software installer would run. So I couldn't use that virus software because I couldn't download the Easy CD update because Roxio didn't like the serial number that they themselves put on their product.

The second episode was in December when I bought Toast 7 for Mac and mailed in the $20 rebate forms and stuff. Today I received a postcard from them saying my UPC barcode didn't qualify. What the h%#&!? When I tried to contact them, I had to register but their new user registration page was totally blank.

"To be honest, I'm a big fan of D.G. so my review can therefore not be complete objectively. Anyway, this dvd contains very good pictures of David's playing while his explanations are really clarifying his grooves and stickings. The songs he plays with the band are not only a fantastic extra, they make you see (literally) how his grooves make the funk work.

I also have his book with audio CD ""The funky beat"" from which the songs are being analyzed in this dvd. I can read the scores in there and the audio recordings of his drums on the CD's are very bright, so it's SEEMS easy to follow. Also his written instructions in the book are really clarifying all about the nature and background of the specific rhythms. Once you start playing, you'll discover it's a completely different game to make this sound even a little stable....

But this dvd with visual recording and David's spoken comments were very, very helpful getting my playing (more) consistent. It offers an unexpected insight in his technique and the direct link between sound and vision while he's playing, opened up a much clearer view on his approach of things. Maybe it's because of how my learning works but I noticed that my progress in playing D.G.'s work went steep up.

I'm not a pro working drummer and play for fun only but I enjoyed every second trying to get closer and closer to what makes D.G.'s grooves so virtuoso. I'm sure it will do the same for you. And myself, hmm, I still have a loooooong way to go....;-)))

Why would I use an overly simplistic Metro app when I can download a Desktop app that does the same thing but has a TON more features?  Doesn't make sense!

Throughout the year, I make regular distributions to my partner and to myself.  I have tried booking those alternatively to our equity accounts or directly to retained earnings but nothing works.  Whatever I do, when I am ready to import the Quickbooks file into Turbotax the result is nonsensical.  Additionally the program does a horrible job of explaining the implications of the questions that it asks during the interview process.  For example, if you make special allocations to one or more partners it is nearly impossible to reflect that properly on the tax return and on the K-1s.  It is absolutely stunning that two programs which have been around for so long and which are sold by the same company could inter-operate so poorly.

The program flags discrepancies which are not really there.  For example some entertainment expenses are only 50% deductible.  Not surprisingly, once the adjustment to the book income is made, there is a difference between book income and tax income.  However, I have found no way to simply accept that difference and move on.  If the difference can be explained by the different treatment of expenses for tax and book purposes, why do I have to tear my hair out trying to trick the program into accepting the differences?

"Peachtree Complete (5 user) was always relatively expensive to upgrade, but it was nevertheless worthwhile to do every 2 years. A few years ago, as our small business grew to employ around 25 people we purchased the Quantum version for many thousands of dollars. So far, so good..... Unfortunately, not long after we got Quantum, Sage changed their business model so that every year you would have to bleed financially to ""upgrade"" your software. And the upgrades are pitiful for what new they offer.
So now, Sage has figured that as no one wants their expensive upgrades they are going to make the continued functionality of features which change annually (such as payroll) subject to exorbitant service contracts. This in effect means that if you don't upgrade or purchase an annual service contract for zillions, your software downgrades.
I suspect Sage is unwittingly engineering the demise of what is a good product. Some call it greed. I call it stupidity. My version, Sage Peachtree Quantum 2012, still does everything I need (as I never used the payroll function) so you won't see me upgrading to a newer version of Peachtree (sorry Sage....I love the word ""Peachtree""....those were the good times) until Sage's policies change.

"I bought this for my 20 month old daughter in hopes of finding a simple, engaging program. Sesame Street's First Steps exceeded my expectations.  The features that I especially like are the Parent's initial choice between keyboard or mouse activities. My daughter gets to choose from 8 keyboard activities and four mouse activities. All of the activities have verbal prompts from: Big Bird, Elmo, Ernie and Baby Natasha. The graphics are better than the Reader Rabbit Toddler program. Now this is a very basic, cause and effect type program. The baby pushes a key or moves the mouse and they get immediate rewards. There is the option to repeat each or move on to another screen. My child especially likes the silly songs and ""Do As I Do"" activities. She gets to imitate hand motions to some of her favorite songs and learn new ones.  I am very pleased with this program because my child ends computer time happy, she can follow the directions (with adult supervision) and successfully complete the activities.

Parent Bonus: Once the program is installed you don't have to put the CD in to use the software!

The only cons are that when in the keyboarding mode, the Windows key will bring up your start menu in the middle of the game window. But most of the other  games out there do that too.

"I am one of those unsuspecting customers that buys the Deluxe version of TT at Costco as soon as it goes on sale with rebate.  I did the same thing this year.  I installed the program and downloaded the previous year tax return with no problems, just as expected.  What I did not expect, was that when I went to enter my K-1 income (I am self-employed, that's the only income I have), I was greeted with an invitation to upgrade to TT Premier!  Say what???!!!

So I picked up the phone and called TT customer support for explanation.  I was given a line about how it's a better product now than before, how it's streamlined across different platforms, etc.  I told the lady that I am not happy about not being able to complete my tax return, and she immediately offered to make me happy by upgrading to Premier version at no cost.

That is why I rated this product 2 stars - one for being deceptive to begin with, and one for CS effort to fix the problem.  I am tempted to tell my local Costco store to place a sign above the Deluxe version that it's not the same product as in years past.  I would also recommend to Intuit (and/or Amazon) to place warning on their site just below the name of the product:

 DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION IF YOU HAVE K-1 INCOME.  THIS FEATURE HAS BEEN REMOVED IN 2014 VERSION.  PLEASE PURCHASE PREMIER VERSION INSTEAD.

"As others who have posted here have noted, Microsoft has discontinued Microsoft Money.

"At the time I am writing this review I have only used the graphic design, vector illustration, website creation / file management, and a little of the Flash capabilities of this product. I have not yet started using the video editing functionality.

My standard tools for this sort of work have been Adobe PhotoShop, Dreamweaver, Illustrator and some ftp tools. I found that everything which I have done with these more expensive tools was easy to do with CorelDraw Premium Suite X5. A couple of highlights include:

 - Corel Capture. I use screen shots all the time for user documentation, etc. The Corel Capture software that comes with this package offers some handy ways of capturing screen data, as well as content from other sources. It can capture other content such as video playing on part of your screen. It is a handy tool in general.

 - Corel Draw is their answer to Illustrator. Illustrator and I are not particularly close as I lack a skill that is key to its successful use - artistic talent. That being said, Corel has all of the tools that you would need to make the full range of vector drawings and art work you can do with Illustrator. I have a feeling that Adobe is always a year or two ahead in functionality, but Corel then works to add features pioneered by Adobe.

If you are a casual user of the various tool sets offered in these packages, Corel can save you a lot of money without sacrificing functionality. On the other hand, if you are using these types of tools at work and everyone else it running Adobe apps, chances are that you are going to have to stick with Adobe so that everyone can use the newer features.","The price is right.

"I would second David Cotter's positive reviews.  I only have a mere 20 years of development experience starting with a NeXT cube I bought back in 1990.  Today I work for a 200b financial services company that runs twelve 10.4 Intel XServes.  We are very cautious to upgrade as they machines are heavily used for production work in the marketing and reporting arm of the company where we heavily use Perl, AppleScript, shell scripts, Python, etc..  There has been perhaps 1-2 anomalies on individual machines that we had to reboot and do some repairs for - in perhaps 6 years of heavy use.  We have hundreds of Windows, Solars and Linux servers, VMs, blades, network servers, you name it.  Our 10.4 server reliability compares very well with the rest of our environment.

It was based on this experience I evaluated Snow Leopard Server by creating a Parallels 5 virtual machine on my Mac Pro desktop machine at home.  I honestly wasn't sure it would work on a VM but I was running a live wiki/blog/calendar with people live connecting from all over for 2 weeks.  There was one crash across a week of work - but I put my workstation running the VM to sleep several times and one of them the server didn't seem to wake up from correctly.  That's tough environment for a server.  I was very impressed with the improvement in management tools and the wiki is actually much better than the average wiki - my technical team that was testing it gave it rave reviews for usability.

I was so impressed that I decided to buy a Mac Mini Snow Leopard Server for my home.  We aren't ready to upgrade at work yet - that will require several months of testing with a set of development servers.  But based on my initial experience I would expect the testing to go fairly well.

I'm writing this somewhat preliminary review because that first guy was spewing hatred without any concrete facts and that's just rude.  The fact is that with running a web server, blogs, e-mail, dns, open directory, file shares, etc. is very complex.  Unlike reviews of simple products which might approach objectivity in some sense, complex products like server software can't be reviewed in an objective way.  Reviews of OS X Server are going to be about how combining one particular guy with OS X Server for a while worked out.  Apparently not very well for that first reviewer.  My experience has been overall very good.  Could be that the first guy is dumber than David Cotter or I, but it's probably because the kinds of things he was trying to do were not working out for him and the solutions were painful to find, if he could find them at all.

I understand this.  Apple does not invest in the enterprise at all.  The problems I've had with OS X Server are probably more difficult to resolve than on other platforms because of Apple's lack of interest, and the fact that far fewer people travel the OS X Server path.  This results in far fewer hits in Google on your problem than you would expect with a Windows Server problem - tons of people have problems on Windows servers.

So here's my recommendation.  If you are a computer novice that barely knows how to click a mouse but for some reason wants to set up a web server or wiki for your little company - OS X Server is DEFINITELY for you.  It's actually ridiculously easy to set up most of the server features and if they work, which is likely, you are going to be very happy.

If you're moderately technical: 2-10 years of experience working with server technologies, or have a lot of experience but you just aren't that good, then you probably want to use a Windows server technology.  You'll have lots of support, lots of stuff on the web, a broad range of software solutions, and there is a contractor around every corner that can help you out.

If you have a ton of experience and the most daunting technical problems don't really phase you any more (they might take days to fix, but they don't phase you), then I think you will really like OS X Server.

"I do freelance bookkeeping and payroll for a number of clients, and the old PC I was using for work finally gave up the ghost.  So I decided to get VPC instead of a new PC, as I really prefer my Mac, and financially it made sense.  The program I'm using VPC for is Quickbooks Pro 2004.

My computer: Rev. A Flat-Panel iMac, 800 Mhz G4, 768 MB RAM, OS 10.2.8

The installation was incredibly smooth and fast, which pleasantly surprised me.  By default, VPC wants to install Windows in your Documents folder, which seemed bizarre to me, but I installed it in the Applications folder with no complications.

Things started to slow down after that point.  Setting up Windows took *forever* (as at that point I was on the ""virtual"" machine, which for me runs at 233 Mhz).  The good news is that when you finish a session in VPC, the program saves Windows' state (as if it were hibernating), so the next time you don't have to go through the interminably long process of waiting for the virtual machine to boot.

I encountered trouble when I tried to print to my HP 920c, which is a USB printer.  After doing some googling, I realized there is an update patch to VPC (7.01) and after installing it, printing works fine.

As for using Quickbooks, it's really quite responsive and I have no complaints.  It's easily as fast and stable as it was on the 5-year-old PC I was using, if not moreso.  I think the key to VPC is being realistic about what it is and what it's intended to do.  For my purposes, it's perfect!",Be realistic,False,1103155200,2.772588722239781,1.0

However, I recently bought a PDA and wanted to use it to track my finances.  I read the reviews and there are a few items that I would encourage you to look at if you are going to buy this product:

2.  Does your bank charge to download Quicken files

One of my banks that I have savings in is not on the list but this is no big deal as it is a savings account that I don't touch.  And my primary bank does not charge to download Quicken files.

"I have given this product a ""1"" for lack of a lower number.  It is really bad. The presentation is so cheap-looking that it is obvious cutting costs was the most important thing considered by the company. I could not find exactly what was on each CD by just looking at the packaging (as was the case with another version) because each one was packaged in a generic sleeve (white, no print) that did not specify what was on each particular one. There was no manual either. Easy to use? Don't believe it.  I have Windows XP and I felt it was not REALLY compatible.  I called the company and sent e-mails requesting assistance in installing, etc. and I never got a response from them.  Bad product, worse customer service.  Another problem, which they do NOT mention when they advertise the number of graphics (over 1 million)is that you have to subscribe after a year to have access to that many.  That, to me, is false advertising.
I had a previous version and was happy with it (gave it away when I switched to Windows XP as it was not compatible), but I will never buy another product from this company.

"I have used this program for over 4 months now. It works much better than version 6 which had alot of bugs in it. I have used Mcafee Virus scan since the early 90's. They have really improved it over the years. This version has a built in firewall program, which is really nice since I use a cable modem to connect to the net. It's very tight, it will tell you what programs are trying to access the Internet. You have complete control of what you allow and not allow.  In the beginning it's kinda annoying, because you don't really realize how many programs you have try and access the internet. But once the config process is over or completed for the programs you have loaded and use, it's not so bad.

I find it to run so much smoother than version 6, I was about to switch to Norton but I got a good deal with amazon and just tried it one last time......they fixed what ever it was in the previous version that was causing it to hang up and slow down my machine. I guess the biggest reason I wanted to stick with Mcafee before I jumped ship was that Norton charged after one year of dat files.

"so, why the positive review? It took me about half an hour to learn how to edit with this program. I may have to edit and update this review if I figure out how to navigate better. The biggest flaw is there isn't a pause button like Sony Vegas has. The pause button is what really made editing for anyone easy. The tutorials don't explain how to edit well either. I think Magix is missing the bus with this, and I know they do read the reviews, and respect the fact that they don't put out fake ones.

From my point of view, I see the 3 biggest flaws with this software are as follows:
1. THE NO PAUSE BUTTON ISSUE
2. THE HORRIBLE TUTORIALS
3. NO SETTING MARKERS TO PROJECT LIKE IN VEGAS
In fact, I've even watched tutorials online by YT users, and saw that they edited by hitting the plus button to pinpoint an exact point to place the marker. The best way to teach others how to edit is by using the ""Set Chapter Marker"" Button(as well as using the plus button on the bottom right). After you get the exact spot by moving the marker, you can easily use the razor blade to either remove start, remove end or split. The ""Set Chapter Marker"" is everything you really need to know
because you can edit right at that point. The fades are varied as well, and are extremely user friendly.

Post editing: If you go to the help menu, you can download FREE menu templates, so when you pop in the disc, you can see a nice presentation with video movement and music. There are a varied assortment of templates, and I like them very much. They are very professional or fun looking depending on the mood you're looking for.

MP4: I mainly use this program to edit with my Kodak Playfull and Kodak Playsport. I have an older version of Sony Vegas (6.0), and have read in a couple of places that the newer version of Vegas has the same problems with MP4, as the older versions. I have no way of verifying this, but this is the main reason I went with Magix.
I'm very very happy with Magix, although during the first half hour I was extremely frustrated. If you follow my advice from this review, you'll save yourself a lot of heartache. It really is great editing software.

I purchased a Mac Mini in May 09, my first Mac. Fortunately for me, the sales rep was a Mac person himself and was able to show me a few of the many perks of having this little machine.  MobileMe software was not included, but he was super cool and hooked up discounts and rebates if I purchased the Mini and MobileMe.  My monitor is being repaired right now, so my Mac is not directly accessible at the moment, but my iDisc is.  All of my documents, music, movies, pictures, and anything I choose to have on my iDisc is accessible through the online MobileMe cloud!  So, all my assignments I had saved for research papers can be uploaded to my PC!  Seriously, this software saved my butt!  If you are a Mac person, I highly recommend you invest in a mobileme account!  I purchased mine through Amazon for $61.00 flat, shipping, tax, and my new Individual MobileMe.  You can't beat that price anywhere, it's normally $99+tax!",Great Investment @ a great price for people who are both Mac & PC users!,True,1274054400,1.3862943611198906,1.0
I absolutely love this. I have almost 100 books in my Cloud Reader and this makes it easy to sort them into different categories. I just don't understand why this isn't available as an app for the Kindle Fire. But in having it on my computer is better than nothing because I have access to my book while I'm anywhere as long as I have the PC with me. I have several different collections (categories). Mystery; Romance; Paranormal; Fantasy; Recipes & Cookbooks; Horror.. Makes it much easier to find the type of book I want to read next with just typing it in except for look in a library for the book for hours or having to get someone to help you do all this. My first book on this app was a great success in loading and convenience that i have never looked back to a library. Here online I can find any book a want with a click of a mouse. Nothing else compares to it. The download takes a little over 5 secs to be fully downloaded to your PC and boom there you have all you need right in front...

"I own a later edition, FlipAlbum Vista, but see no difference in the versions I have owned since version 4.  The software produces very attractive computer based books of photo albums.  The pages visually and audibly fip and make a nice appearance.  The main problem is that the albums, although advertised as able to be made into DVDs, are limited to the computer.  This novelty wears thin quickly.  In addition, it's somewhat of a fraud that the software is advertised as being able to create DVDs that can be played on TV.  Yes, DVDs are technically created but the quality is so poor that they are virtually useless.  This is not a problem I alone have as the manufacturer's website is filled with complaints about this problem.  It's very odd since the flipalbums viewed on the computer are so nice.  But, there must be a problem with the software's ability to burn to DVD because the DVDs are totally useless as the quality is so poor.

Our taxes aren't that difficult, i.e. about a dozen forms to enter and then a $280. prep bill.  I keep all our documents well organized paper clipping the w2's and other incomes together, and similar with expenses and deductions. No shoe box type filing system that they complained about.
Well back to this year's(2012) tax software somewhere while entering our info the software calculates a $214+ million income and the ""you owe the fed"" area lists taxes due of $60 million. I searched for a while and couldn't find any entry errors but totals still showed erroneous values. I called customer service and worked with a gentleman on the phone for about a half an hour. I uploaded my info and he saw the issue but didn't know how to solve it. His supervisor told him that they have heard of this issue and they needed to escalate my case.

"Finally decided to take the plunge and move our quickbooks over from Windows to Mac. I had no idea what pain and suffering I was in for. The Quickbooks 2012 says that it makes it easy to import windows files, but I found that I had to go back and export for Mac to make it work. Once I did import I found that all my online accounts had to be re-set up and that I couldn't get them all to match what I previously had.  The worst part of the transition is payroll. If you use Quickbooks for payroll on Windows your payroll plan does not transfer. You have to close out your windows payroll and re-enroll in Mac. Trying to get this little bit of info took almost an hour on the phone with Intuit where I was transfered to no less than 5 different representatives.  The kicker here is that the payroll service for Mac is CONSIDERABLY more expensive than windows. For us this meant $60-$80 more a year for payroll services, an extremely high premium to use the version for the mac.

Many of the features in the Windows version aren't present in the Mac including the all important Accountant's copy.

I've begrudgingly used QuickBooks for years manly because its the only game in town. I've endured price gouging, incompetent support and technical issues.

"This is a review of both the BaseCamp software and the US 24K West map data as used with a Garmin etrex Vista HCx on a Mac platform.  I've been using the old MapSource software and US 100K data for several years and I've also been using the National Geographic Topo State series software and data for a long time.  For working with the etrex, the BaseCamp software represents a significant improvement from what was available before.  If you have used the old MapSource software to load maps onto the GPS, not much has changed, it is just as slow and tedious as before - over 4 hours to load 4 GB of maps onto the GPS.  But, for route and waypoint transfer, BaseCamp works really well.  You can even drag and drop individual waypoints or routes back and forth between the GPS and the software.  BaseCamp shows a list of all waypoints, routes, and tracks on your GPS.  These can be hard to find on the GPS itself.  I'd accumulated a lot of stuff in my 2 1/2 years with the etrex.  Theoretically you can delete individual items from the GPS using BaseCamp.  BaseCamp tried but didn't work with my etrex - don't know if its a software bug or a GPS limitation.  I ended up downloading all of this data to my computer, organizing what I wanted to keep, deleting everything from the etrex using its menus, and then uploading the keeper data back to the etrex.  I could never have done such a chore with the National Geographic software, but BaseCamp makes it quite simple.  BaseCamp also allows you to create folders to organize your route/waypoint data.

OK, those are some highlights of my experience using the software, here are some pros and cons:

Pros:
  1) BaseCamp is a significant upgrade from MapSorce (especially for Mac users) providing excellent waypoint, track, and route exchange with the GPS.  If your GPS is plugged in, BaseCamp is talking to it.
  2) The 24K map data provides routable roads and many routable trails.  The 100k map data is not routable.  The 24K map data allows you to see combined elevation contours and routable roads.
  3) BaseCamp will create routes following trails and roads on your computer using this new data.  Of course the GPS can do this as well when you are in the field.
  4) BaseCamp shows you the map data as it will appear on your GPS.  It is simpler in appearance than the true USGS topo map copies that the National Geographic map data provide.  This is good or bad depending ...

Cons:
  1) BaseCamp uses the essentially unchanged MapInstall software to transfer maps to the GPS.  This is a slow process.
  2) There is a skeletal Mac help file for BaseCamp but no other instructions.  Plan on doing some experimenting to figure out how it works.
  3) The 24K install DVD installs a quite obsolete version of BaseCamp and the other software even if you have the latest already installed.  Plan on going back to Garmin's WEB site and downloading the latest software.
  4) I find the map data (all of it) to be cluttered with too much business POI data and so far haven't figured out how to hide it or delete it.  Show me the parks and peaks but get rid of all the little business people run from their homes!

The BaseCamp software is still quite primitive which makes it easy to learn but serious users will find it lacking.  With the exception of the Points of Interest data the maps are simplified for showability on a GPS unit.  If you want to print out nice trail maps, I would suggest using the National Geographic State Series.  For organizing and exchanging data with your GPS, BaseCamp is the best I've seen.  Even if you decide against the 24K map data,  BaseCamp will work with the older 100K maps and is available free from Garmin's WEB site.  I will continue to use both software sets for the time being.

A note on trail coverage: Another reviewer complained that the Skyline to the Sea trail near Santa Cruz, Calif was not shown, but should have been.  The National Geographic maps don't show it either.  I would suggest, as a general principal, that you should never just rely on your GPS but also have decent trail maps.  I hiked that trail several years ago and used the NatGeo software to create an approximate trail route.  Following the path in front of me and supplementing that with my GPS I did just fine.  On the other hand, last year I backpacked in the Dinky Lakes wilderness.  Those trails are all present and routable in the Garmin 24K data.  Using just the first and last waypoints from the route I created last year, the BaseCamp software created a route following the trail much more closely than my freehand attempt had done.  So a significant improvement but there is always room for more.",Significant Upgrade from old MapSource,True,1286150400,1.6094379124341005,1.0

"I've been using Norton Anti-Virus in its many incarnations for over 5 years. Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations. Even for computer super-heros it's a pain to maintain when there is a problem.
Bad:
Buggy program: I've had random Norton crashes forcing a reinstall of the product, not just once, but five times total on two separate systems. The uninstall/reinstall is a huge headache as others have pointed out.
Accounts: If you are the only user that logs in on the computer and don't have children using the computer, don't install ""accounts"" (or parental control). It's very buggy. You must be logged in as the Windows administrator and as the Norton administrator to make changes to the Internet Security portion, and even then it's hit or miss.
Privacy Control: The ad-blocking blocks many websites, some which you may wish to view. The screens to make changes are well hidden in Norton's configuration menus (here's a helpful hint: Privacy Control > Configure > Advanced > Add Site - type in website that has blocked features, check or uncheck desired features). Very unfriendly user design for such a popular consumer software product.
So-so:
Firewall: Getting better, hard to understand for basic users, not enough features for advanced users.
LiveUpdate is an essential feature to NIS. Symantec now charges an annual subscription fee for anti-virus definitions & program updates after the first year. The subscription implementation is one of the reasons it is so hard to completely uninstall the program.

"Last evening I downloaded Quicken 2013. The advertised mobile/iPad app is exactly what I've been hoping Quicken would add.
I have been using Quicken 2011.
Product installation went OK and it seemed to import all of my Quicken 2011 data OK.
When I went to update my accounts,  Quicken 2013 first wanted me to register the product.
So far so good.
After entering name & address, etc., it told me that I had successfully registered and gave me a button marked ""Finish""', which I clicked.
THE PROGRAM FROZE COMPLETELY.
I had to use Task Manager to get out of it.

I contacted Intuit support by email and sent screen shots of what I was experiencing.
This morning I followed up with their Chat support line.
I got responses from both channels saying that I should uninstall then reinstall in C:\Quicken rather than the default directory.
I was assured all would be fine.
I tried that. Twice. All was not fine.
Every time I got to the end of product registration, Quicken 2013 froze completely.

Adding to my frustration is that the 2013 installation process uninstalled Quicken 2011. I don't have the download to reinstall Quicken 2011 and if it's on Intuit's website,I couldn't find it.

So now I have a request in to Intuit that they 1) tell me how to reinstall 2011 and 2) refund my purchase of 2013.
If they can do that, I'll be back where I was, having lost only a day.
If they can't do that,  I will spit on their corporate grave.

Do not upgrade to Quicken 2013 unless and until you see through review in this forum or similar that they have released a useable product.

Having said that, my personal tax situation probably wouldn't warrant a CPA in my opinion. Which is debatable. However, since this is my Turbo Tax review, let's get started.

I've been using TurboTax for years now. It is a good product (so far, no audits!) and has pro's & con's. For this to be a completely honest review I should be able to tell you that it is better than H & R Block's or TaxACT's software. I can't do that which is why I've rated this four stars. (As a side note, a CPA probably uses a professional version of some tax prep software ...our tax code is far too complicated ...which is another debate.)

I have used a various versions of TurboTax over the past several years: Deluxe, Premier and Home & Business. Depending on my situation, each version has helped me prepare my taxes and I believe has done a good job finding deductions and ensuring that I am compliant with U.S. Tax Law. This year I chose the Deluxe version.

Pro's - Buying TurboTax through Amazon.com came with a $35.00 off coupon for Quicken Home & Business (I rated it four stars as well.) Amazon's digital download is easy and installation and update of TurboTax was easy and pain free. TurboTax also does a good job of gathering information about you and offering advice - one of the big pluses for TuboTax. Be advised, however, that the process of entering all your personal and income information can be tedious. You'll be asking yourself, ""Another set of questions?!"" The questions are necessary and it really doesn't take as long as it seems. TurboTax is also constantly updating their software and the updates are usually a matter of clicking a button.

The Con's - Correcting mistakes can be a bit of a pain. I wished the software would be more helpful, or at least explain better as to why the number I entered this or that form doesn't jive with some other number on some other form. (Having said that, what exactly do I expect for $40?) Another con is lack of explanation even when I clicked on the circled-question-mark in some sections. Past versions of the software were better at providing a bit more detail than this version. Some explanations were obvious reprints from some obscure IRS form. In other words, no explanation or help at all. (I would bet money that there is an official government bureau dedicated to taking simple explanations and making them as convoluted as possible.) My biggest complaint is that for $39.99 you appear to get your federal AND state included in the price. Not so much. I did file my Federal return electronically, but there was a $20.00 ($19.99) fee for filing the state (Virginia in my case). I believe that TurboTax could do a better job explaining that. I took the paper route and printed my state return and mailed it in.

Overall, TurboTax does a good job and the Federal & State reviews usually find a few errors that are correctable - some more easily than others. I also like the ""Audit Risk"" section, as I can't think of anything more annoying and scary (at the same time) than an IRS Audit. The Con's don't outshine the ease of preparing your own taxes, however. Considering the price, the time I spend filing, and knowing my taxes are done, I am pleased with TurboTax.

One side note: You are rewarded for using TurboTax year over year. A lot of the tedious data entry can be eased a bit by using a previous years file. TurboTax will ask if you need to update, but at least the typing is done ...unless you need to update.

FYI - my standards for a 5 star rating:
5 Star Requirements
- Price point must be reasonable (I'd expect a $500 piece of software to be great)
- Must hold up to daily use with no (or very few) issues
- Must be easy to use, or set up (e.g., I don't have to sing while standing on one leg to get it to work)
- Must perform as advertised (none of this ""your experience may vary"" crap)
- Must have a bonus feature I find valuable

While I certainly expect some difficulties in installing the software, this years' Deluxe Edition just would not install despite of several attempts, including H&R Block's Customer Support Solutions.  Essentially, you have to shut down all programs, via MSCONFIG, and run the install program.  All I could ever get was the intro message that tells me it was going to install the program and then it would be followed by the message that the program did not install properly.  UGH.  Sending it back.  Good luck to my fellow Block users.  You would think that an annual program, like H&R Block Tax Software, could be written that installs without incident by now.

"First of all let me say that the negative reviews out here are more than baffling to me except that it almost almost has to be people that either didn't follow the directions to the ""T"" or don't have as much to lose as I do with changing computers.  Another possible option is people that are not at all technical may have some struggles with it.  As a PC Tech my main computer systems are highly customized - countless applications, tools, etc and an unreal number of files, documents, database files, etc, etc.

Changing computers or reformatting my drive to reload the OS/Apps is a major nightmare that t literally weeks for me to complete.  I have to dig deep into my records to find licensure information, keys, etc and the cost to me in downtime and stress is so bad that it's something I will avoid sometimes for months longer than I should.  I'll endure a slow and unstable system for months before I break down and go through all that.

Introducing Laplink's PC Mover.  GONE are all the headaches aforementioned.  I moved from a 32-bit XP Pro system that is around 6 years old (an old Dell laptop) to a brand-spankin new Asus laptop running 64-bit Windows 7.  I had plenty of trepidation, believe me - to the point that I let the box sit on my shelf for over a year.  When I first purchased it I was just going to reload XP on the same system, then I bought the new laptop and it was time to make a decision. I had talked to a co-worker that'd had perfect success with the product so...I jumped in with both feet.

Let me just say that the 5-stars tells the story.  It went FLAWLESSLY.  Sure there were some apps on the old system that weren't compatible with the 64-bit OS; especially when combined with Win 7...but instead of crashing with an ugly blue-screen-of-death I was allowed to simply uncheck an app that was incompatible.  Everything from my registered, legal copy of MS Office 2007, with all docs, PST files, etc to the less popular programs I run on a daily basis...nearly all transferred with registry entries, licenses, etc - all in place flawlessly.

I highly recommend that anyone that is not quite technical get someone to help you that is - perhaps hire someone to assist.  You can most definitely do something wrong and cause a total failure on the new system.

"This software does not do what it claims to do. Most of the useful functions are in the Pro version only, which costs 5 times as much. After struggling for 4 hours to draw a 2D profile, when I went to extrude it, guess what? It's only available in the Pro version! Deluxe can only extrude primitive forms - circles, rectangles, arcs - but not complex curves. Useless. I am unable to make a 3D solid from my 2D sketch.

The program could not do a decent offset on a Bezier or Spline curve. Several times I drew something and it would not show up on the screen, but then I'd save the file and re-open it and presto! there it is.

I was VERY disappointed in this software. I know $99 is cheap for 3D design software compared with other programs out there (AutoCAD, Rhino, Solid Works, Geomagic) but from the writeup and reviews, I thought this software would at least function at a rudimentary level.

From this perspective Ive got mixed feelings after using Home Designer Suite for a couple of weeks. There is a lot of good and also bad from my point of view.

This may explain the variety of scores this product got along many reviews.
-
Looking from the angle of getting a complete solution, ranging from drawing foundations until furniture and gardening, the overall impression is that those who developed and are maintaining the software have a profound sense of professionalism and respect for their customers. You will not have to get through a call center to get individual attention! On the other hand, you may also feel that the roots of the development of this solid software are not all in this century, as it was not developed to be adherent to mass market requirements of today where easiness of use is king. So you may at first glance conclude, in average, that this software is more appropriate for technicians and not for eventual users willing to rapidly draw the home of their dreams.
-
The basic conception of this software is solid but also rigid. I am not saying that this is true for the very basic tasks, where things have been developed to work fine and surprisingly smooth. The automatic roof building is a nice example of it as well as wearing rooms with furniture while working on 2D and 3D screens at the same time. But when you start diving 2"" under the surface of easy basics, youll stumble on a huge variety of problems. Most of them have a workaround. And they are well documented through one of the most robust and comprehensive support systems (FAQ + forum + videos + webinars + documentation + etc.) I have ever seen for any kind of software. Best in class in this sense, I would bed. But one might see all this as a way to compensate lack of easiness of use.
-
As you work with the program youll notice that each problem you face is a problem for itself, there is no rule of thumb to solve it, you must find your way throughout the huge amount of available support/content and it is not always easy to find what you want. This does not only turns the learning curve difficult, but later on, if you do not regularly use the software, you may easily forget what youve learned. Sometimes it looks to me that this program is more an adaptation of a rigid old fashioned CAD program added with innumerous adaptations to smooth a little bit its usage in certain areas.
-
After using the software for some time and starting to dive into details, youll clearly notice that robustness and exactitude comes from rigid parametrization. So within the freedom given by the parameters, you can make your projects in a very accurate way. But the downside is that you can only change the parameters that were previously defined. And unfortunately not everything is well parametrized. And there are also some parameters that you cant even change. If you do not find a solution for a problem in the predefined set of parameters, you most likely have to spend hours to find a way to circumvent it by applying special tips and tricks which are in no way intuitive or obvious. However, the number of such special solutions is impressive and well documented as emphasized before, but not easily accessible. There is no clear guidance through this jungle, although you will always get an angel at the company to give you a lift in the most critical cases. Here and there you also will be surprised to unveil intuitive well-done problem solutions that were not (clearly) documented. But do not expect too much in this direction.
-
Despite existence of innumerous ways to circumvent a problem, for some of them there is no solution at all, depending on the version of the program you have acquired. In fact the amount of software pieces which make software blocks work together in a smoother way are sold in form of features in the different versions of the program. Apparently, to the extent I could understand from Chief Architects advertisement, in the Professional version of Home Designer, youll find most of the problems solved in form of easy-to-use features, without needing to make lengthy researches and learnings to get it only partially solved through painful ways. But having to spend almost 500 box for it seems to be out of the real world. If we would talk about $200.- for the Professional version, it would make sense. But for $200.- youll get only the Architectural version which is only slightly better than the Suite version (as far as I could understand from advertising).
-
Below find a few examples of significant troubles Ive faced, regarding the Suite version ($99.-):
1) Setting the huge amount of defaults are not concentrated in one location, leading to a lot of confusion and waste of time;
2) Some defaults as particular wall definitions (like external wall color) you cannot predefine, leading to further lengthy and painful wall by wall setting;
3) No real freedom to design roofs as you are bound to a strait jacket of predefined roof patterns that are difficult to get adjusted to individual needs;
4) Roof always running over ceiling edges. No way to make roof fixed over low walls built above ceiling. And no way to have ceiling structure running out of the wall boundaries;
5) You cant set wall height individually, as this can only be done on a room by room basis;
6) Stair designer quite limited. If for instance you try to make a U turn stair without intermediate landing (i.e., angled steps in the U turn required) you will likely have to ask for individual support;
7) After workarounds, program behavior turns sometimes uncertain and erratic, eventually requiring painful rework;
-
To close this short review I would like to say that Ive spent hours and hours to learn just a little bit. Home Design Suite is a world for itself and just an expert will be able to take full advantage of it. Fortunately I am retired and spending all this time has not been a reason for giving up (for others it might be). On the other hand I must underline that I am very happy with the exactitude of the outcome of the plans Ive done. So Ive decided to stick to the product, even knowing its limitations and that the learning curve has not really finished. Due to the lack of deep and reliable reviews of this kind of software it scares me to jump to another competing $99.- product. I did not find a single clear lead that would give me confidence to give another specific product a try. At this moment I guess that any try could lead me to significant efforts that could not payout.
-
Balancing all these considerations against all the nice upsides the product has to offer (and they do are plenty, besides the overwhelming technical support), I must say that I am rather happy than dissatisfied. Life taught me that you cannot get the ideal by $99.-.
Perhaps some of the criticism I made above is not valid, essentially because I could not manage to turn into an expert. And my excuses in advance to those who developed the product is the low level of easiness for a newcomer to make quick progresses.
-
Finally I would like to underline that the three stars I have granted to this product are an absolute score looking from my personal experience and point of view, looking from Brazil where I live and also considering  the price. It couldn't be a relative score as I was not able to compare it to other competing products.

I updated last year to Pro X7 and I am so disappointed.
I just can't take it anymore, so I will uninstall it as soon as I finish writing this review.
The main issues:
- It takes forever to start, about 1 minute to load the settings.
- It keeps creating and adding the folders in the My Documents folder. For a few reasons that have nothing to do with the program, I need the settings saved to another folder. I go to preferences, I point to my custom folder and next time, I have again all the folders in My Documents.
I had no choice but to leave it there as there is no way I can waste 1/2 hr each time to change the directory to my folder each time.
- The last issue that 'broke the back of the camel' was the fact that crashes all the time when I scan from a network scanner.
I can only scan one page normally. When I scan the next one, it seems to scan it ok, but at the end the program encounters an error and closes.
I can start again the program, but it keeps crashing no mater how many times I try to scan. Only restarting the computer would allow me to scan again one single page!
What a disaster.
Just to prove how little common sense people that wrote this program have: The ""Save As..."" icon shows an arrow pointing away from the 'floppy disc' icon, which I have not seen anywhere else before.
I am looking for something else, and I feel bad that I wasted the money and so much time with this version.

"Should you upgrade? Well, kind of, I tend always upgrade to the latest from Symantec. For this version I only recommend that you upgrade to ""Norton Anti-virus 2005"", the programs from Symantec such as System Works and Utilities are just the same, no major differences except for a more sleeker interface and the obvious bloat of it. Doesn't even include features your getting for free in Windows like a FireWall, which comes free with SP2 for Windows XP. The introduction of technology such as Activation was not smooth, and caused a lot of headaches which only makes the product less embracing than it use to be.

Symantec needs focus on areas such as Speed, Seamless Integration with Windows, obviously it has lost it. My next purchase from Symantec won't be in the retail line, but from Enterprise space. The Corporate Edition of Norton Antivirus, it offers all the tools I want for protecting my PC, yes it cost a lot and its targetted towards the Large Networks, but it is so subtle and easy to use and it does not bog down your PC.

"So I believe this is the best illustration product available right now to use with my Surface Pro 3.  I tried a bunch of different programs and judged them using these criteria:

Pen handling / Pen lag on Surface
Pressure sensitivity
Brushes / mixed media / customization
Layers / Selection
User Interface suitability for Tablet PC

So here's a rough comparison with some other tools: (CSPP = this product, Clip Studio Paint Pro)
Photoshop CS6.  This is a desktop app that isn't suited for the tablet.  The interface text is too small.  The Pencil tool is terrible, while CSPP's pencil is pretty good and lets you adjust a host of different settings including texture!  CS6 is made for desktop and Cintiq, and I find changing colors to be awkward.  CSPP lets you press the button on the pen and it turns into the eye dropper tool!  Perfect.  CSPP is made for tablet, so standard zoom, rotate, and move gestures with your hand work just fine.  Plus, if you can pick Tablet PC in the settings which does palm rejection correctly so you don't accidentally paint with your hand resting on the screen.  CSPP has great illustration features, like the way strokes respond to pressure.  You can adjust sensitivity to stroke width, opacity, flow, etc, and resetting defaults is a breeze.  All the default media options are pretty good right out of the box.  PHOTOSHOP CC's SUBSCRIPTION MODEL IS DEAL-BREAKER FOR ME.  I hate subscription models for software with a passion, and CC is just an insult--you can buy CSPP for the price of one month of Photoshop CC!

Mischief.  I like the way Mischief's pens are adjustable and the way the pen handles, but the infinite zoom, pan, and vector based framework make it unsuitable for production artwork.  Mischief is good for sketching ideas, but CSPP let's you make finished pieces you can submit as part of your portfolio, actual manga panels, or even textures for games.

ArtRage Touch: They claim it isn't lag, but the program's pen handling isn't great and the gap created by their stroke anticipation was something I just couldn't get used to.  ArtRage offers great mixed media types including an amazing oil paint, but CSPP is just as good.  Plus I prefer the way colors mix right on the canvas with CSPP instead of ArtRage's mixing system.  In CSPP, the color you pick mixes with the paint on the canvas as if it is wet, which is similar in ArtRage except ArtRage always starts with the color ""overlaying"" the existing paint before sort of petering out.

Sketchable: Poor pen handling, the user inteface is a little awkward, and the simulation of mixed media is not nearly as good as CSPP.  CSPP's pencil, watercolor, and oil paints are all quite good.

Autodesk Sketchbook: Something about the interface and the way you change brush size and pick colors is just awkward.  I find it slows down the process of illustration.  While I admit the pen handling and pressure sensitivity is quite good on Sketchbook, I find I prefer the way CSPP handles the various types of media, especially oil paint (I don't remember Sketchbook providing oil paint mixing on the canvas as a feature.)  THE SUBSCRIPTION MODEL FOR PRO, ALTHOUGH ONLY $24.99 / year, IS STILL ANNOYING.

Corel Painter also seems to be made for desktop, and there were issues with the pen handling and interface.  Not to mention it's nearly $500!

I've already written too much.  I consider myself an amateur illustrator but I've got lots of experience with physical media like pencil, charcoal, conte, watercolor, and oil paints.  Obviously a Surface pen isn't going to provide the same brush experience as a real fan brush, but I'm amazed at how faithful the experience is given the limitations of the hardware.  You can go wrong with this purchase at $25.

And the people that gave the product one star reviews don't seem to know how to use a computer.  I had ZERO issues downloading the software, installing it, and entering the product key to activate it on my Surface Pro 3 running Windows 10.",Best illustration software for Surface Pro,True,1487116800,2.772588722239781,1.0

So they took away a bunch of functionality and provided you with NO WAY to put it back. Here's an example of why this is so bad: In outlook, I hate the preview pane so I turn it off.

"After seeing the bad reviews, I almost didn't purchase PDF Producer. However, I called Data Becker (during normal business hours at 617-614-0600) and, with very little trouble, got a live person on the phone who answered all of my questions and allayed my concerns.  Two good hints: It only works with Win 2000 or XP (as it says right on the specs); and, it's important to close ALL programs (including printer software) running in the backgroun before loading.
PDF Producer loaded flawlessly in a few minutes on my Windows XP system with MS Office 2003. It works just like any other printer driver, and I personally like the idea that it doesn't intimately integrate with other programs (such as putting an icon on the task bars) -- if something does go wrong with PDF Producer my other programs are still in business.
The product works excellently -- making PDF files of anything that can normally be printed. The PDF Producer settings needed a bit of tweaking to get the quality and file size I wanted, and this was easily done following the built-in help screens or the manual that came with the retail package.
PDF Producer doesn't have all the functionality of Adobe Acrobat, but at about 1/6 the price it is a very cost-effective solution for turning just about anything into a basic PDF.",PDF Producer is an excellent product.,False,1067731200,2.7080502011022096,1.0

"It's a shame that one has to endure Microsoft products that have issues. I spent over three hours trying to upgrade from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 8 Pro (32 bit) only to get to 90% installation when a message pops up saying ""Failed Installation"". Twice I tried and twice Microsoft has succeeded in living up to its typical expectations. On the plus side at least after the failed installs it goes back to Window 7 like nothing has happened. In addition, I went to their website to find the ""Upgrade Assistant Tool"" to see if it showed any issues, it only showed a few programs that still have to be reloaded after installing Windows 8. This is strange because during the failed installs, using the purchased Windows DVD, this did not pop up as an issue. The only reason I purchased this version, is because it would work all programs after installed.
One would think that somewhere along this journey you could receive some support or at least a hint on why it will not install, but not so.  It gets more difficult to baby sit products that are not better supported and require one to spend hours and sometime days dealing with it.

"Text recognition is very good on a simple, typewrited page but, hey, there are sharewares that do this for free. I tested Omnipage mainly on complex textbook pages with headers, 2 columns, figures with legends. I chose 240 dpi as a compromise between size and accuracy. The result:

1. When converting a 2-column page to PDF, the text flows ACROSS the columns instead of down then right. Useless for cut & paste. Also, word search is not sequential. Omnipage support never answered my questions on this issue (nor on any other).

2. Figures with small objects on a contrasting background (e.g. birds flying in the sky) are interpreted as text, with laughable result. In general, the recognition of image fields was bad.

5. Figure legends were systematically included with the text around them instead of being assigned to a separate text box.

4. This beast needs A LOT of CPU. I ran it on a 2.8GHz P4 and it was crawling through the pages.

5. Not an Omnipage issue, but as an aside: Omnipage offers to save the text as a MS Word file. Note that MS Word will not open a file larger than 32 Mb. I did not know this. Did you?

"SnagIT 12:  1 star of 5.

I used SnagIt7 for a long time.  Anything SnagIt7 lacked in features it made up for with its responsive, fast, clear interface.  With SnagIt 12 we have the opposite - the user interface was designed by an artist, not anybody who knew a thing about usability.  It takes forever to make a screenshot (there seems to be some artificial pause built into it) plus you must press an extra button to tell it you want a 'photo' screenshot not a 'video' one.  The drawing tools are really really bad in SnagIt12.  First of all, they used monochrome large icons for thsee.  to move to more drawing tools and options requires unnecessary scrolling.  I still haven't foudn the single head bendy arrow.  Changing line thicknesses, etc all requires going into menus and submenus - what a pain in the backside!  And then, because everything is an ""object"" now, positioning one object on top of another to annotate the screenshot quickly exposes some ui bugs and annoyances.  I tried snagit12 for one week.  I'm now back to snagit7.

The good news about snagit12 is that it does video capture and you can annotate it.  and, it actually seems to work.

"I've had occasion to use Laplink PC Mover two separate times. Once for transferring files from my husband's old computer to his new one; and once for transferring files from my old computer to my new one.

The transfer of my husband's files was first and went a bit smoother than my files transfer. However, in both instances, any difficulties I experienced were caused by ""operator error"" where the ""operator"" was me!

Although the directions for transfer were quite clear, when I got to the ""select files"" section in some instances I was uncertain which files to transfer so I just let the software choose. (My husband does not have any MS Office software so his transfer was pretty much uneventful.)

On the other hand, when I transferred files it took four tries and each time I had to start over. Unfortunately, I plugged the USB cable into front of the computer USB ports. As a result, I accidentally kicked the cord on my new computer, which pulled it loose enough that I had to start over.

All that aside, I'm extremely pleased to have had PC Mover to transfer the files. For the most part, the instructions were easy enough to understand and to follow. When it asked if I wanted to transfer applications that I did not know what they were, I let the software go ahead and transfer it.

Also, because my old computer has lots and lots of documents, files, software, etc., the transfer took a long time.

The PC Mover software that I used also came with PC Sync, which enables me to sync my two computers in the event I want to use the two of them together. That is my plan, although at the present time my original computer is at the shop.

"I had previously written a review on this item, but it seems to have disappeared. I'll do my best to recall my previous review.

In a nutshell, Corel's WordPerfect OfficeX7 is an attempt to create a (more or less) drop-in replacement for certain parts of Microsoft Office. In particular, you will find ""cloned"" versions of MS Word (a word processor), MS Excel (a spreadsheet program) and MS PowerPoint (a presentation program). Obviously, this is not meant to be a full-blown replacement, as it lacks its own versions of MS Outlook, Access and some proprietary extensions that you can only get from Microsoft.

The results are a bit mixed. For those of you who are casual users of Office, there is no steep re-learning curve to speak of. If you are a ""power user"" who has memorized many of the keyboard shortcuts, menu trees and other items that let you whiz through Microsoft's products like a pro, it can be much more difficult to get used to.

For the most part, this product lets you open most files created in Word, Excel and PowerPoint without any problems. You can then edit or modify them and save in a variety of different formats, including most traditional formats used by Microsoft (i.e. .doc, .xls). If you are creating a document from scratch, you should be able to save it in the same variety of formats, so that someone using MS Office can open it without knowing that it was created by WordPerfect. This seems to work about 98% of the time and when it doesn't, it is not always the fault of WordPerfect to be fair.

Compared to the ""real"" Office, Corel's product fares pretty well for the most part. It's biggest drawbacks seem to be lack of documentation, lack of support, some occasional software instability and the few instances where compatibility of documents does not always work exactly as it should. For the ""average"" user, these trade-offs are probably worth the considerable price difference. In corporate settings or other situations where you might actually need professional support, MS Office is clearly the safer bet.

The main reason I give this product only 3 stars (other than the limitations outlined above) is due to the fact that individual users can get what is essentially the same suite of programs that are included in WordPerfect Office X7 for free elsewhere. OpenOffice (Google it) is an open source version of MS Office that includes all of the same programs and features as Corel's version. Due to the fact that it is open source software, it is distributed for free though. I have used this product for a number of years and if anything, I find it to be more stable and better supported than Corel's version. I would offer a list of reasons to buy Corel's version vs the free version, but I honestly can't think of any.",Office On The Cheap,False,1404000000,0.0,0.0

"I had Norton but it really slowed my computer down.  I mean it really hogged resources.  And for what?  I've had PC Cillin for a couple of months now and I have't had any problems with viruses at all. The AV protection is really excellent and for a lot less than Norton.  That alone makes it worth the investment. It is fast, has a good auto update feature for the AV and firewall along with a GREAT spam feature (Turn it up to its highest setting and then start building a white list)that I love, since it has decreased my spam by about 90%.  With the White List, you can dump almost all your spam into a spam folder and delete it all without clicking on it (a quick browse will suffice to see if there are any real messages) and spam will rapidly decrease. A good trick is to sort the spam by sender making it easier to spot any missed messages and to add the senders to the white list. There's also a black list, which I have found helpful.

As far as the spyware detection goes, it could be better, but it really isn't bad at all.  I'm sure it picks up the real nasty ones out there and my computer speed stays quick and consistent, so I know it is working more than some of the negative posters have said.  I have Ad Aware professional and even it doesn't pick up everything.  I would just download and use SpyBot Search and Destroy and run it once a week along with the free AdAware.  The Anti Virus feature of PC Cillin is quite exceptional for the price you will pay and that, I will say again, is alone worth the price of the PC Cillin product.

The PC Cillin interface is easy to use. I have had no problems with the auto updates and the firewall offers the same settings for whatever environment you are working in that Norton does, such as at the airport or at home.  I tested the firewall with a couple of online firewall testers and they didn't find any open ports.

There is more to write about this product, but I will end with saying that I would recommend it if you are an average or business user and need basic to intermediate protection from hackers, as most of us do.  If you are at real risk from attacks, then you might want to get something like Norton, but then you would also probably be able to afford a machine or network system that could handle the unbelievable resource hogging that Norton subjects your system to.","Good Product, Fast, and NOT a HOG!",False,1153612800,2.302585092994046,1.0

"I wrote a review when I first used the 2011 version, and then erased it. I just went back to modify my Health Care Proxy, which is one of the documents this software provides in addition to the Will. I had forgotten how cumbersome it is to navigate through the meager 4 or 5 pages of this document, and how difficult it is to print. Without counting print pages carefully (and it's very cumbersome to that in their layout), you'll waste alot of paper.

I also find the ""help"" and suggestions for dealing with issues in the Health Care Proxy or the Will itself, to have a downside. It's supposed to give you an example, but if you don't think of things in detail for yourself, it will only open a can of worms, confuse you and result in awkward and inadequate statements of intent. So in the end I wonder, what good is this software, if it's always telling you to seek legal advice, you have to think long and hard about all your stuff and what to say and not say, and it's an absolute bear to print out? The answer must be, it's cheap and has the veneer of legal validity, it provides a framework I guess. Others seem to like it, and in fact I'm using it for now, but it could be better.

I find Intuit software in general, to not be a good organizing tool, but something you need to not let organize you, while you make the effort to organize yourself.

"I received the Basic edition bundled with a very nice Plextor burner. Most of my experience so far has been with the EMC 7 Capture function.

The bundle itself is truly bloatware, and loads tons of stuff that you will never use. It would be nice if places like Roxio would add a one-line description of each useless package's function, with the option to install or not after reading.

Capture is the kind of program designed to be ""easy"", meaning you never really know what is happening. It does (mostly) capture video. However, it will hang periodically with cryptic messages, to which the only option is click ""OK"". Then it starts over from the beginning.

The Smartscan feature would theoretically be great (you must make sure your DV camera supports this function). My cam (PV-GS200) does. However, the purpose of Smartscan is to fast-forward looking for scene codes on the tape, to let you preselect the scenes you want to capture. Unfortunately, it gets lost, a lot. Once Capture has lost its place, the only option is to start back over at the beginning of the tape. It will invariably hang at the same places, so after wasting a LOT of time and over-exercising the fragile tape, you will give up and just Capture the whole damned tape (have a very big hard drive handy).

Now that you're capturing the full tape, it will hang in other places. It hates when you have fast-forwarded the tape in camera, because that causes a black frame that it cannot seem to move past. Eventually, you will find that the best option is to manually move past the spot with the controls on your camera, then start capturing from there... but you will never really know what the software is doing until its over.

Never knowing what the program is doing, and having neither options nor meaningful Help when difficulties are encountered, is the recurring theme of this whole software suite. The only Help you will get from Roxio is their user forum (which is pretty good); otherwise, their idea of support is to try to get you to buy an upgrade version.

I believe much of this stems from trying to make something which is still inherently complex (video capture) overly simple for some perceived grandparental audience. The problem with all the friendly screens is that they blithely assume nothing will fail. When problems inevitably arise, there is no recovery other than Start Over. You will never know where you are in a tape, where your restart begins, what happened to the video you may or may not have already captured, or what to do to manually jumpstart a stalled capture.

The same look and similar issues were thoughtfully embedded in the Videowave authoring suite, although I have not had much experience with it, given that I am spending most of my time capturing and recapturing (I think).

I am not sophisticated enough to recommend something else yet, but there has to be something better and I would recommend you find it instead of anything from Roxio. Their whole progression as a software megabundler has been toward sales and away from functionality (and support) and it is really a shame that a first-class outfit like Plextor had to ""partner"" with them.",Keep looking...,False,1113264000,2.772588722239781,0.0

"It really bugs me to see or hear so called professional web designers complain about web design software. If you truely are a professional, then you should be quite capable of breaking out the old MS NotePad or WordPad to re-edit any of the program's output to suit your needs. Now with that being said ...

The last time I tried to do this HTML stuff was back when the W3C standard was HTML 3.2. The standard is currently 5.0 and many things have changed. At the time I stopped designing websites, CSS was still new and XML was still an experiment. Which means that I have a whole bunch of catching up to do before I can even attempt to edit my own HTML again.

I wanted a WYSIWYG web design program that would work much like the old MS FrontPage software from back in the day. The Serif WebPlus X5 appeared to fit that bill and it was quite reasonably priced here at Amazon. My heart was set on the MS web design software but the price kept going up and that software is quite old. So the Serif WebPlus X5 was the next best choice.

At first I wasn't crazy about the software but then the realization hit me that the Serif WebPlus X5 works more like desktop publishing program rather than an HTML editor. After that realization things became much easier to handle.

I am not crazy about not being able to change the HTML output from inside of the program but as it was with the old FrontPage software, I'd just have to make those changes using MS NotePad or WordPad. You can add HTML and Javascript ""code snippits"" from within the program but you can't change any of the Serif created coding. Not a real big problem to overcome.

I am a little disappointed that the program is still using the W3C 4.1 standard for it's HTML output. The program isn't very old and I would have liked it better if it was using the newer 5.0 standard. However, the site that I've created does display correctly in the 3 browsers that I have installed on my computer (MS IE8, Firefox, and Google Chrome). That sure beats the old days where one went crazy trying to code for all of the different browsers.

For the newcomer to web design, this Serif WebPlus X5 software is exactly what you need. If you know how to use desktop publishing software then you will easily be able to get your website created and published it to the web with the 'built in' FTP program in no time flat.

You can publish your site to any web server that your site is hosted on. Statements made about being ""married"" to Serif's web server are quite untrue. Sure you won't be able to use the ""Smart Objects"" tool to add things like a guestbook, forum, blog, chat, or counter because that ""Smart Objects"" tool is related to the Serif web hosting server. However, there are plenty of HTML and Javascript ""code snippits"" available on the web that will help you in the creation of such objects or pages.

I highly recommend the Serif WebPlus X5 for all users of any skill level. From the beginner to the (cough, cough) professional this software does get the job done and done quite well.",Serif WebPlus X5 is a great buy!,True,1333324800,1.0986122886681098,1.0

DD Ste. v. 10.0 is, in my opinion, grotesquely unintuitive. Maybe they just want to sell tech support to their users?
A more logical reason may be that the syntax gets lost in the translation, if indeed DD Ste. v. 10.0 is made overseas.

"I've been using Quicken for about 15 years and am highly upset about their move to a subscription based model. No subscription, you can't have your data. That's it, I'm done with Quicken.

To my pleasant surprise, Moneydance was able to import all of my Quicken data without a hitch. While the interface is different, it only takes a few minutes to get used to the new format. After a short time, I think Moneydance is better. I like the summary page - everything I want to see is there. The reports are available on the sidebar, which is handy.

The investments summary page also has everything I want to see in one presentation - including an asset allocation chart, current value, and % change.

As for an earlier reviewer who didn't like Moneydance's input screen asking for account number and routing info, you don't need to fill that in. Just enter the username and password and Moneydance will grab the info for you.

Moneydance also has some nice programming hooks if you want to expand beyond it's initial capabilities. For example, you can run a Python script or download an extension. Moneydance is also available in Linux (check their website).

The software isn't perfect and some of my banks are not supported by Moneydance directly. However, all these websites do indeed support download by QFX, which Moneydance will handle without a problem. This is not a problem for me, as my Quicken file was already broken and I was doing this anyway as a work-around for Quicken's poor product quality. (Starting from a clean Quicken file does not help.

"I've been using this Rosetta Stone program for about three months now. Overall, I am very pleased with it. The program's interface is well-designed, I've experienced no bugs or glitches, and I am making progress faster than I thought I would (or at least I think I am).

Rosetta Stone's method is based on a technique called ""Dynamic Immersion."" You're immediately thrown into the language you want to learn -- there's no English allowed. This sounds daunting, but the software starts you off at such a rudimentary level it isn't intimidating.

Thankfully, the app employs a good variety of interactive methods (matching pictures to sentences, writing caption for photos, hearing words and phrases pronounced correctly by native speakers, etc.) so the ""by rote"" factor stays low. Rosetta Stone says its techniques are modeled on how native speakers actually learn their own languages, usually while still kids, and I think that's a good description for what the software delivers. You start with words and then move on to phrases, and then with level two you get to conversations. Level three kicks the conversational up a couple of notches. It's a natural progression.

I think there are people who prefer a more standard ""grammar-first"" approach because they've found in the past that this is what works for them. I imagine there are also people who don't like looking at computer screens for lengthy periods. These are valid concerns. There are different pedagogical approaches for a reason -- not everyone learns in the same way. My guess is that Rosetta Stone would serve the majority of people very well, especially students who are comfortable with computer-based learning. Ideally, I think this program will work best for people who are studying a language using many ""inputs"" (text books, audio programs, computer apps, foreign-language media, foreign flicks, native speakers, etc.) All of these things will ultimately reinforce one another. The more immersion, the better.

I really like how the program keeps track of what areas I'm botching and pulls me back into those areas for more work. I also like the pronunciation practice via the included headset, although I can't verify it's always catching me when I'm mispronouncing things. To my ear I'm doing OK, but my ear isn't the best, hence my use of this program. If I'm pronouncing things badly and the program isn't always catching my errors, I'm not sure how I'd know, if you see what I mean. My hope is that I can nail the rudiments of German and get a good grip on simple conversations using Rosetta Stone before trying to find people to practice with/on, thus keeping my embarrassment factor low.

I'd give the app five stars but I cringe just a little bit at the price. I don't think it is overpriced for what you get, mind you, but the cost -- well, it is what it is. There is a demo on the Rosetta Stone Web site that I encourage you to try before buying. It'll give you a good idea how well this program will work for you. If you like the approach, the price for all three levels is well worth it.

Keep in mind that learning any foreign tongue will realistically take a while. Rosetta Stone shortens the learning period a good deal and makes sticking with the program easier, but it's only a foundation. Still, it's a pretty darn good one, and I can see why it's so popular with people traveling overseas for the first time as well as the international business community.",A truly interactive approach to learning German,False,1229990400,2.079441541679836,1.0

"I don't like to give negative reviews. But there is a big difference between what is claimed and what the reality is.

I downloaded the DEMO version of Photoscore Ultimate 7 and gave it a test drive - attempting to transcribe a couple of .mp3 files. Unfortunately, the product failed miserably.

This is very disappointing because Neuratron's PhotoScore is a good product. Thus, I expected the same quality in AudioScore --- no way.

To be fair - the Quick Start Guide states 5 caveats: 1) it can't recognize percussion, 2) has difficulty picking out light higher notes in presence of low heavy ones, 3) Can't separate two instruments playing the same note at the same time, 4) Has difficulty with rhythm in musing with heavy sustain or reverb, 5) It can only handle 16 notes playing at the same time.

My comments:
1) Caveats 2,4, and 5 are killers for me. It rules out about every popular/religious song that I would want to transcribe.

2) Only caveat 5 was mentioned on the web site promotions.

3) The Project screen (where you do the work) presents snippets of wave forms in different colors. The different colors represent different instruments. It's up to you to select them and then assign them to an instrument. The problems are: selection and assignment is unreliable and the snippet colors are not consistent. Thus, you have to struggle to select and play each snippet to see what instrument is should be assigned to. All this must take place before transcription. It is an extremely time consuming process.

4) You have to tell AudioScore the time signature - that's fairly straight forward until you have to line up the vertical bars on the Project screen to indicate which snippets begin or end a new bar.

5) It picks up lots of noise from percussion - making it extremely difficult to sort the snippets.

Bottom line -- as far as transcription from audible music to a score, the limitations rule out general use. The process is too time consuming and fraught with errors. The advertising / claims on the web site grossly overstate the product's ability at this stage.

Avoid it unless you have ridiculously simple music to transcribe.",Not Ready for Prime-Time,False,1343088000,1.3862943611198906,0.0

"Like reviewer M. Brown, I find that my proofing takes about 1/4 the time in Omnipage than it did in my previous long-time favorite, ABBYY FineReader!  That's a good thing because the first item I proofed would not export to Word due to an internal ""Invalid Object ID"" Error.  I had to re-proof it from scratch.  So it took a total of 4 hours rather than the 8 I had spent on the same document in ABBYY.

The second large document that I proofed also refused to export due to an ""OPD internal error"", but I got it freed from the bit-prison by saving the ""OPD"" (OmniPage Document), closing, and re-opening.  Then I was able to export.  The next 4 documents exported fine.  I still save my OPD and export to Word frequently -- just in case.  Saving an OPD file is a good opportunity to get up and stretch for a few minutes.

Omnipage made a HUGE advance in character recognition with this release.  I've used several different OCR products and this is by far the best for character recognition. Sometimes 20 to 30 pages will fly by without any manual proofing required. It works well even on very old documents with obsolete fonts and ""blobby"" printing.

Its manual character training ability makes it a breeze to handle special symbols and foreign characters.  But it does not allow you to train it to recognize repeated graphic characters like small star separators.  Nor can you train it to handle combined characters like the Latin ae. There is also a self-training capability.  It detects corrections that you make while proofing and gives you the option of applying similar changes to the rest of the document.

I'm used to having ABBYY OCR the whole document before I proof. In order to effectively use the training capability, you must now proof as it recognizes.  This means you may have to interrupt a job more often with Omnipage.  It does not remember the page you were on when saving (see even more thoughtless user unfriendliness below), but it does recognize and skip pages you've previously proofed when you start proofing again, so you just have to wait for it to get to the right spot if you exit the program then come back.

Pros:
*  Extremely accurate text recognition.
*  Good paragraph layout retention including quoted paragraphs (indented on both sides), right-aligned letter closures, and similar.
*  Handles words from multiple languages in the same document very well.
*  Excellent handling (minimizing) of text styles for export to word.  (ABBYY seems to create a style per paragraph sometimes which makes it almost impossible to do generic reformatting by style.)
*  OPD are treated as a single object by windows rather than the complex file and nested folder structure of the ABBYY saved items.  This makes for much faster backup or delete of these objects.  ABBYY also will not overlay its saved objects - you have to manually delete them.  Omnipage will allow overlay of OPD objects.

Pro and Con
*  Omnipage flags far fewer ""questionable"" text characters than ABBYY does.  That's a real relief since ABBYY seems to flag every standalone 1, I, or l.  On the other hand, a few errors do sneak thru like 111 (for I'll) and // (for italicized If) without being flagged for review.  You will need to scan for common OCR errors in the exported document.

Cons:
* Technical support made me reinstall the product with my anti-virus and all other startup programs turned off to try to solve the Invalid Object ID error, and it did not help.  Maybe the vine version of this program is just a beta and I'm supposed to be beta testing for them?

* OP occasionally decides that one- or two-line sentences at the top or bottom of a page are headers or footers and leaves them out of the export along with the correct headers and footers that you want to leave out.  This means you must manually review every page of the document before finalizing in order to avoid lost text in the output.  (Note that Omnipage correctly OCR's a phrase with the ""one- or two-"" type of structure.  It does not convert them into optional hyphens.)

* Typically, OP creates at least one wrong forced end of paragraph per page.  On a page with lots of short dialog, then most of the actual multi-line paragraphs will get split up into multiple one-line paragraphs.  ABBYY is a bit better in this regard.

* Stay away from work flows unless you like your software to do inexplicable things at the strangest time.  (It's really easier to just remember to manually (1) - acquire pages or open a pdf, (2) - OCR with proofing, and (3) - export.

* The Kindle export workflow did nothing that I was able to discover.  I don't think it even recognized that my Kindle was plugged in.

* OP has the World's Worst user interface I have ever seen.  Honestly, I have many years of computer experience and I've never used a less intuitive application.
 * Page up/down keys do not work in the image or text editor panels.  Why not?  (Neither do cursor keys, nor threats, nor prayers) You have to go over either to little tiny arrows way over in the left hand bottom frame to page up/down or to the edit menu!  Just to page forward!  (To be fair, you shouldn't have to page manually often, but sometimes it is required and every time is a reminder of how inconvenient it is.)
 * Page thumbnails do not synchronize with the page images or editable text panels.  There should be a button to press to show the thumbnail of the current page in the thumbnail panel.  I've never seen a program with a thumbnail list and a full-size panel fail to have this synchronization before, have you?
 * It's way too easy to hit one of the tiny jump to beginning or end of document double arrows when you are trying to hit the tiny page up/down arrows.  Good luck on finding your way back to where you were as there's no jump back button.
 * When you toggle ""show headers/footers"", the option is way up on the left of the screen in the view menu while the headers and footers are on the far right top and bottom.  Why can't you just click in the header/footer or in the body to switch this (like Word).
 *  Short chapter or section numbers or roman numerals are often dropped from recognition even if they are not at the top or bottom of a page.  This is something else you have to manually review (like dropped text in a header/footer location) before you export.
 * The recognition zone type is shown as a pretty large graphic icon overlaid on the upper left corner of the zone, which prevents you from seeing the words under it during proofing.
 * There is a fancy graphic help screen (which no doubt dazzled some marketing manager) which shows up first if you press help.  Then you have to find a tiny option in the lower left of that screen to get the ""normal"" windows help dialog with table of contents, search, and index.
 I could go on whining about the many, many little inconveniences of using this program.  The good news is that you rarely have to use anything but the proofing dialog box, and, although it could also be improved, it is serviceable.

"it LOOKS PRETTY

that is all the have going for it.
You see how pathetic rosetta stone is by the theme in their ads now.
I saw a new ad where THE WHOLE TWO MINUTE ad people were dancing and singing/rapping

wow, just wow

anyways there are two options you should try.

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pimsleur/dp/0743523571/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pimsleur</a>"", they teach you USEFUL phrases, but thats where its usefulness stops. Use this if you are a beginner ONLY.

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Story-Time-Language-Learning/dp/B005EVJYQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Story Time Language Learning</a>"", this picks up where pimsleur left off. If you try it you'll see what i mean. Even their BASIC program which is 10 lessons is more involved than 30-50 lessons of pimsleur.
They both have VERY similar set up, but ONLY use this program if you have tried another program or if you are a quick learner.

here are the differences between the two:
1) pimsleur starts with a conversation of what you WILL learn. Story time ends with a conversation to test you
2) pimsleur relies on LISTENING. storytime requires that you read along as changing accents in words changes meaning (esta vs sta vs est) (si vs s) (porque vs. por qu)
3) pimsleur just throws somewhat random vocab at you. meaning random verb conjugations, random cities, random scenerios. Story time presents the vocab in the beginning. There is always a theme per ""Story"" that they presente. Its more organized. They present a verb and conjugate it for the specific tense that they use.
4) pimsleur is very limited in that you could probably never be able to hold a short conversation other than, ""hi how are you, very good thanks"". You can't even freaking say ""i'm hungry so i will eat an apple"" at the end of pimsleur. (If you finished pimsleur, try it, see if you can do that) Storytime on the other hand extends every story little by little to the point where you can independently make a unique sentence.

5) this is the most important point. Pimsleur is for BEGINNERS. Like i mentioned previously, you will get more out of the 10 BASIC lessons of storytime than 30 lessons of pimsleur. Pimsluer at the moment only offers 120 lessons in Levels 1-4. Storytime offers 100 lessons on just their Level 1. its ridiculous how much faster you can learn when you READ ALONG! Too bad pimsleur couldn't figure out that concept.
6) Level 1 of pimsleur is $350, times 4, $1400 for levels 1-4. Level 1 of storytime is $250 (i got it cheaper, for $200. I'm sure you can email them and ask for a cheaper rate. My friend did it)

"THIS REVIEW ONLY DISCUSSES USING DRAGON TO INDEX THE 1940 US CENSUS.

I have had Dragon Naturally Speaking since version 9.5.  Although it works well, I don't normally use it because I'm an attorney and I find that when I type my wording is easy to read and understand but when I dictate it comes out as typical legalese.  The times I have tried using Dragon at work I spent more time thinking before dictating or editing the dictated text than if I just typed from scratch.

The only point I want to make in this review is that Dragon on Win 7 DOES work with the indexing software for the 1940 U.S. Census (FamilySearch.org).  The best way to use it is to index the images by columns instead of rows. It is particularly useful for the House Number, Given Name, Relationship and Place of Birth fields.  Say the item, press Down Arrow. Say next item, down arrow, e.g., ""Fred"" down arrow ""Harriet"" down arrow.  It MASSIVELY speeds things up--and you don't have to worry about spelling errors on place names unless a word has two spellings (some cities are Pittsburgh and others are Pittsburg).",Works with 1940 US Census Indexing software,False,1334966400,0.0,1.0

"The newest version of Zone Alarm Internet Security Suite 2007 is absolute crap.  I only wish I could give it 0 stars.  Trust me...DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  The version I got is the latest build, and I had nothing but problems from the day I installed.  System (actually I have it loaded on 2 laptops) takes up to 20 minutes to shutdown, and XP user switching, which should take less than a minute can take up to 5 minutes.  And I thought my Norton product slowed things down.

Today, though, was the topper.  I scheduled the virus scan to run every day at 2:00 AM.  On one machine it didn't run, and the ZA control panel said it was in the process of downloading updates.  I waited....and waited; a full half hour, and updates were still being unloaded??? Clearly something was wrong, so I had to shutdown.

On my other computer the system said the virus scan was still running.  Now since I checked my computer at 6 AM, that means it had been running for 4 hours.  Again....????  Worse yet, though it indicated it was running, under files scanned it showed zero.  Again, I shut my system down, since obviously something was very wrong.

I contacted ZA, and their answer re my slow shutdown problem was as follows:

<------- WHEN REPLYING, PLEASE TYPE YOUR TEXT ABOVE THIS LINE -------->

""Hello Frank,

Thank you for your inquiry. This is a known issue. At this time there is nothing else I can recommend other than to revert to 7.0.337.000. Please download this version of the Zone Alarm Security Suite by clicking on the following link:

[...]""

In other words, our new product doesn't work, so just go back and use a prior version.  Talk about bad business!!!!

Needless to say, I won't bother downloading this earlier version. In my mind this suite is total garbage, and now I need to see if my computer acts up post-removal.  I hope not, since I ""think"" I cleaned all remnants using CCleaner.

Finally, I'm contacting Amazon about this problem.  I guess it should have been obvious to me when the price of the new release was less than the older release that there was a problem.

"I used Norton Ghost 9 for a couple of years and just recently upgraded to Ghost 10. Both versions have performed flawlessly through numerous backups of my two computers. I've also restored one or the other of those two computers several times with version 9 and once with version 10. In each case, those computers were restored to the same condition at the time of the backup used. In fact, the computers seemed utterly unaware of the restorations, with everything (software, drivers, files, and so on) operating normally afterwards (just like nothing had happened). Windows XP had to be re-validated after each restoration, using the automatic online process like a new installation. Otherwise, Windows also behaved just fine after the restorations.

Ghost obviously cannot perform miracles on a seriously dysfunctional computer, such as one with hardware issues or one so chaotic as to actually corrupt the operations of Ghost itself. However, Ghost does indeed serve well on a normally healthy computer temporary experiencing problems easily resolved by a product like this. Since good computers do occasionally mess up, a good backup solution is an essential tool. Given our success with this product, I now consider Ghost that tool and can highly recommend it to others.

Having said that, it is also worthwhile to say something about the negative reviews here. The only problem with review sites like this is that you often only see two types of people posting - those truly enthusiast about a product and those truly dissatisfied. The vast majorities in the middle, who buy a product, install it, use it, and go on about their lives, rarely take the time to hunt down a review site to comment. Furthermore, it is a little hard to get overly enthusiastic about a software tool like a backup utility, especially after spending an hour or so installing and then backing up a computer with it. So ultimately what you see most often posting here are the relative handful dissatisfied with Ghost, not the many millions installing and using this product without finding anything worth commenting about. After all, that (install, use it, and forget it until needed next time) is exactly how a good, well designed, software utility like this is supposed to work.

In the end, when reading the negative reviews, ask yourself how (if this software is as bad and as flawed as the reviewers claim) all those other people (like myself) are able to install and use it without any problems whatsoever. It's very easy to deny problems with a computer and blame it on something else instead, just as it is easy to install another product to bypass those problems temporarily (not fixed & will likely reappear in the future). Again considering my own long-term success with this product, I have to wonder if that is exactly what some of the others here are doing.",Ghost Still Remains The Best Backup Solution.,False,1150329600,2.8332133440562166,1.0

"I work in a highly integrated setting with Windows/Mac and mostly MS Office generated media. I have both Office and iWork on my computer.

"Hype is one of the most startling games that I have ever had the honor to come across - I found myself pleasantly surprised by it.  I must admit, I wasn't really too sure about this game at first, I mean it's a game made by Playmobil - a company that makes those lego-resembling toys for young children.  What kind of game could you possibly expect coming from this children's company?

I have nothing against Playmobil, just for record, I find the Playmobil toys to be some of the most impressive children toys out there.  The attention they pay to detail in the toys is just amazing, and you can see the reflection of this detail in Playmobil's Hype: The Time Quest.  The graphics are not perfect, I'm not saying that at all.  But I love that they don't lazily throw something together.  Take, for example, the time when Hype is to get into a battle in front of a whole arena of people.  Typically in games I find that the creators of the game do not give the audience faces, all of the people are the same just duplicated. But in Hype you'll find that the audience all look different, I'm sure that any Playmobil fan would have a fun time trying to recognize the faces of the Playmobil characters you see in the audience.

This leads me to another aspect of the game that is impressive - the characters.  The characters are so loveable, so funny, so unique.  I can recall even the very minor characters in my memory because they were just so unique.  Usually in video games I do not even bother to talk to the town people because they usually say the same thing; which is usually telling you what you have to do next - but this is not the case in Hype.  Some characters will scream at your presence, some will welcome you, some are complete lunatics that just make you laugh.

The only flaw character-wise that I see is that the character that you play as, Hype, never talks.  You never really get to know his personality because he never says a single word and doesn't really act out anything in the short movie clips that there are in the movie.  Some people would view this as a good thing because it shows that YOU are Hype, and Hype's personality is YOUR personality.  I find this to be annoying, though, I want to know who Hype is.  Hype could never be my favorite character in this game because we don't really know who he is.

Some games have such impressive storylines that the only way to show these storylines is to have a bunch of those movie clips, and very long movie clips.  Hype, however, has a pretty unique, interesting storyline yet does not put in all those tedious, long movie clips. Basically, the storyline in Hype is that the evil Black Knight rained in on their parade, Hype tried to protect the king but ended up getting sent back in time where the game starts and you have to find a way to get Hype through all of these obstacles to eventually bring him back to his present time and defeat the Black Knight. (a very basic description of the really quite impressive storyline)  To introduce this storyline there is a beginning video, but it is not long and tedious.  None of the movie clips in the game are.  You will find yourself run into a good amount of these movie clips but you will never find yourself thinking, ""Gosh! Is this movie over yet?! I want to play!""  The game has a very good balance between movie time and gameplay.

I love the movies, they can be quite humorous at times and are just really full of lively fun.

There is a good balance in the audio levels.  The music does not over-power the character's voices or the game's sound effects.  Yet, it is not so quiet that you can't hear it.  Bringing me to another stunning quality - the music.  I absolutely loved this music.  It matched the story so well and really brought you into Hype's world, it made you feel the emotions that Hype and the other characters were feeling.  I would love just to get this music on a CD, it's so tranquil at times, so joyful at others, it's just really impressive.

The age level for this game, at first glance, looks as though it is more suited for the younger audience.  When I first saw this game I had instantly assumed it was for the ages 5-10 or something of that sort.  For that reason I wasn't even sure whether or not I would like the game.  However, a good friend of mine talked so highly of it that I was persuaded to at least give it a try (and many thanks to my friend for telling me about the game).  You'll find that the game is not really for the younger audience, though.  Sure, the graphics and lack of anything gory makes it seem like a game best suited for the younger audience; but I quickly found that the game has a more broad age range.

The language used is what really got me thinking about it.  It doesn't use innappropriate language, no not at all, but it uses a language that younger children would not understand.  I am a highschool student and there were even a few words that I didn't really know exactly what they meant.  I'm not saying that the game is hard to understand, if you're playing the game you don't really need to understand it all, I'm just saying that it seems like the creators made the game for a broad age range.

Children will enjoy the game because of it's adventures, the charming characters you encounter, and the challenging - but not OVERLY challenging gameplay.

Teens will enjoy it because of the challenge and the puzzles, the character interaction, the music, and the gameplay itself.

Adults will enjoy the game for the same reasons and approve it for younger children because of the lack of gore in the game.

Overall, it's a very nice game.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself while playing and plan on playing it through many more times to come.  If you are a fan of action-adventure games then I highly recommend this game to you.  It's a real refreshing breath of air compared to the more common, gory video games that you see today.",Wonderful game from bottom to top!,False,1109721600,1.0986122886681098,1.0

"I've had many versions of Paperport and the last was 10 on Windows XP.  It was a great document organizer and good for converting documents to .pdf  My problem with 10 was it couldn't handle more than one direction at a time.  If I had to email more than one time in one session, the app would hang.  I'd have to shut down and restart.  Therefore, after every email, if I needed to use the program, I'd have to exit and restart Paperport.  Very, very annoying and a big waste of my precious time.

Well, since I just built my new business PC due to a crash, I stupidly installed Vista Ultimate.  I tried so hard to wait til Windows 7 but I took the plunge to Vista.  Then installed MS Office 2007 Enterprise edition.  It worked.  Then I found out Paperport 10 didn't and I was forced to upgrade to 11.1  After that, Word 2007 croaked very often, giving me a message, ""MS Word has stopped working"".  Since I build PCs myself, this is the first time I ever encountered a problem with Word 2007.  No other app would crash except Word 2007. I'd have to do a repair.  It could work once and then crash again.  I started doing inquiries and research.  I have a tech friend whose setup is the same as mine,EXCEPT he doesn't have Paperport installed and his Office works fine.

After frustrating days of Word crapping out and that darn message, I was about to reformat and start over but my patience was too thin to think about doing that.  I ventured into the MS forums and lo and behold, there were many with the same ""Word has stopped working"" message but only one person had mentioned Paperport 11 and bingo, he hit the nail on the head!  I had installed Paperport Pro 11 with PDFCreate, the same software he had installed too.

If you have the same problem as me, the answer is to go into the registry and delete the references to PDFCREATE by Zeon
REMEMBER TO BACK UP THE REGISTRY BEFORE DOING ANY CHANGES!!!!! Export it to your desktop just in case things get messed up.

There are COM add-ins that messed up Word 1007.
Here's the resolution though:

Go to Start, Run, type in regedit.
Then go to:

1) HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Addins (In my registry, the add-ins are NOT in the ""Office\12.0\Word"" subkey, but in the ""Office\Word"" subkey - Microsoft please take note)

2) HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\Word\Addins

In all situations, I removed the add-in key that had ""Zeon"" in the name. I left any keys with ""PaperPort"" in the name alone.

In addition, there were 2 more changes in the registry I made, not related to Paperport, but in any event they corrected the corruption of Word:

Here's the fix:
The fix was to rename two files, through the following path: Start button/All programs/Accessories/Run and type in 'regedit' and then follow the path HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Microsoft/Office/12.0/Word . . . .  and then change the folder called 'data' to 'olddata' and change the folder called 'options' to 'oldoptions'.

Well, that's it. Word 2007 works great now and Paperport 11 works with my new cheap Canon LiDE200 scanner.  In fact, I find that my scans are much quicker and Paperport 11 is much faster than 10.",Great organizer; be careful if you have Vista with Word 2007 which stops working!,False,1245196800,1.3862943611198906,1.0
"Having used several previous versions of PSE, (Version 7, 9 and 11), on both PC and MAC, I am very comfortable giving this version a 5 star rating.
First, I've noticed that it loads more quickly than previous versions. This is a strong positive asset for me.
Next, I appreciate many of the interface improvements.

The changes may even seem to make this version look ""lighter"" or ""watered down"" but be reassured that the expected power and functionality is still there. I haven't even mentioned any improvements or add-ons.
Lastly, I think the stability and overall performance are quite strong. I've opened PSD project files that I created in previous versions and they work seamlessly.

"You want an honest review? Save your money.

I switched to Money 2004 Deluxe and was so happy to get away from Intuit (Quicken). I laughed for a full year as I enjoyed Money 2004 Deluxe immensely.

Then I ""Upgraded"" to 2005 Deluxe in January. What a mistake.

As other reviewers have mentioned, it is full of bugs and removes features that were in the previous version.

I repeatedly requested a way to set up multiple home page views, as I did in Money 2004. The car page, the home page, etc. I was stonewalled and finally they simply refused to answer me straight out when I wanted a simple answer ""is the feature no longer present?""

Then I sent an email to support regarding 3 bugs I've been putting up with for 2 months.

1) Automatic Sign-in to Hotmail no longer works after running Money 2005. Until you reboot the computer.

2) Accouts do not automatically update anymore, you must manually force the update.

3) The ""Hide this window"" for the updating message box doesn't work. The software never remembers you want the window to stay hidden, so you must constantly close it every time you update.

The answer from support? (paraphrased) ""We can reproduce all 3 of these issues and they've been reported to the developers. Unfortunately we cannot guarantee these features will be added to Money 2005. Send them a suggestion.""

These aren't features, they are BUGS. They should have been fixed IMMEDIATELY. After 2 months they still aren't doing anything about them?

Latest issue: I closed a CD account with my bank. Every time I manually update, I get errors because the account no longer exists at the bank. Is there a way to stop this CLOSED account from updating? Of course not. Tech support told me to reopen the CD account and disable online services. This disables ALL online services for my bank as you can only do it by institution, not by account. I followed his instructions, realizing I would have to re-enable my other bank accounts for online updates. When I did this, Money 2005 was so kind as to connect to my bank and make ALL NEW ACCOUNTS, leaving me with duplicate accounts for every bank account I had been using.

First, closed accounts should not be ""updated"". Duh. Second, the software should allow EACH account to be disabled from online updates, not just on an institutional basis.

Do the developers actually use their own software? I think not.

Whomever is responsible for this pile of garbage should be fired by Microsoft. Maybe they can get a job at Intuit, that's where they belong. Bring back the development crew for Money 2004. Please.",An HONEST review after 2 months of use,False,1111708800,2.9444389791664403,0.0

Ok, that said, here are some more details. First, I'm shocked amazed and confused why they don't tell you what you get in this box set! Here is what's included:

* Six E-Books
-Legal Guide for Starting & Running Small Business
-Deduction Manager
-The Manager's Legal Handbook
-How to Write a Business Plan
-Contracts
-Essential Guide to Federal Employment Laws

* 1 Pocket Book
-Your Little Legal Companion

* A ton of forms. Categories are:
-Business Minutes
-Collection Letters
-Demand Letters
-Bill of Sale
-Contract for Manufacturing Goods
-Partnership Agreement
-Corporate Bylaws
-LLC Operating Agreement
-Independent Contractor Agreement
-Limited Power of Attorney for Finances
-Leases
-Email policy
-Letter to Landlord
-Confidentiality Letter

Ok, this might be a convenient library for some, but pretty much all of these are free in the public domain. For example, the Deduction Manager e-Book is basically a reprint of the IRS publication on the subject. A lot of people don't know that most government publications are not copyrighted (they are public domain) so you can reprint it and claim authorship. Some of these sections appear reprinted word-for-word from the tax forms you get from the library.

The forms can easily be found free online, and they are mostly beginner forms (nothing ""Pro"" here). The little book included here is not helpful at all. It includes advice like:

-> ""Opposites make great friends, but not necessarily great roommates""

and

-> ""Never buy a dog from a pet store""

Huh? How exactly does that help me with my mid-sized business operations? If you need advice like that, by the way, I love the Bottom Line books (much more dense, and much cheaper - get them for 1 on Amazon).

And I think the ""2014"" is just a bit of marketing - almost none of the advice or forms here have changed in 100 years.

I think this is probably better than a Dummies Guide, so if you're in the market for something like that, go for it!

"I purchased directly from Webroot.  I know better but I fell for the PC Mag review (their reviews have become notoriously unreliable).  There are lots of reasons I have uninstalled it and gotten a refund (to Webroot's credit).  I will share a few:

1)  I read the T&C carefully and thoroughly.  They share your personal info, browsing history, etc. with third-parties (undisclosed names), and also obtain personal information from third parties that they combine with that they have already.  How does this protect me?  They won't say.  They just said this:  Our legal team provided the following: ""Webroot requires certain permissions from your devices and collects information about you to provide you with our security services and to let you know about related Webroot security products you might be interested in.""  They can track literally everything you do, every program or app you run (and when), every document you edit, every email, and store that information in their servers.  Isn't that what spyware does.

2) WebRoot hasn't been included in independent testing for a number of years (I can't remember, but about 5).  When I asked why not, this was their response:  ""As far as our participation in AV-Comparatives or AV-Test.org, we have participated in the past. The status of our current participation will likely depend on how cloud security solution providers are tested vs. traditional security solutions. Since the approach to protecting from malware is different, the testing would need to be different to capture real world scenarios effectively. ""  There are a few other cloud-based offerings out there.  It's been years, so I would think that if there was a real will to do so, there would be a testing regimen.  Seems the easiest is to test actual infections and see what gets caught.  That's what the others do.  Isn't that the point of installing this anyway?

3) Webroot discovered one infected file when I installed it and did the initial scan.  IT was one I had written and compiled myself (an EXE)!  It couldn't possibly be infected.  It didn't flag a nearly identical file in the same directory.  Then I executed that (second) file and Webroot flagged it.  Again, that was one I had written and compiled myself.  Two other AV-AM programs ignored it.

4) Webroot brags that it can scan your system in 20 seconds, for which other security software takes about 10 minutes (depending on your CPU speed, size of hard disk, etc.) to do.  Whatever they did in those 20 seconds was nonsense.  My files weren't and aren't infected.  I have since rolled-back my PC's to pre-Webroot and installed other security software that I am confident works (It's not Kaspersky or BitDefender- both highly rated but, to me, equally as security-compromised as Webroot because of their home-nations).

5) I asked support what happens when I uninstall Webroot:  ""Yes, it should remove all traces of the product. If you want to be sure it is completely removed, you can run through the instructions for using the uninstall command below to be sure. ""  (Fortunately I image my PCs every night with Macrium), so I just rolled back to before I installed Webroot obviating the need to uninstall it.  However I did try to uninstall it from one machine before I did that.  It seems to have silently reinstalled itself, because it showed up in Windows Control Panel ""Programs and Features"" again, and had an icon in the system tray again.  Creepy.

6) My conclusion is that Webroot is no better than spyware.  Except that most spyware is free.  I am just glad that Webroot doesn't have my (current) passwords.

"Microsoft Office Accounting Professional 2008 is Microsoft's answer to Quickbooks and Peachtree, two companies that have led in the accounting software sector for a number of years.  Having used Quickbooks in the past (and still do), I looked forward to the opportunity to test Microsoft's software.

As my intent was to only test this software, I installed the software onto a spare computer so that I did not have to worry that this software would somehow screw up my Quickbooks files.  As this software was able to import my data from Quickbooks, I copied it over and imported it into OAP08 -- relatively painless.  For the next couple weeks, I entered data into both Quickbooks and OAP08 (tedious, but had to be done!)

If you've familiar with MS Outlook, and other Office applications, the interface will seem familiar, which I'd consider a plus.  Integration with other Office applications is also a nice feature.  OAP08 seems geared towards the avid eBay seller with its convenient Paypal integration (costs $$ for monthly subscription -- figures!).  However, these nifty features does not make up for the fact that OAP08 is SLOW.  Admittedly, this spare computer is a bit older...

While MOAP08 does the basics well, like many of Microsoft's other products, its not quite there yet.  It may need a few service packs and updates before it performs as well as it should.

"I'm fairly tech-savvy, but I've never spent the time and energy to really learn any serious graphics editing software.  I'm a business guy, and I spend most of my time in spreadsheets, slide decks, and documents.  I started out on the PC and migrated over to the Mac about 5 years ago.  One of the problems I've had consistently even going back to my PC days, is the ocasional need for the ability to tweak an image so that it can be used in a PowerPoint deck or a document.  Some examples:

1. Cropping
2. Edge treatments (borders, scallops, irregular shapes)
3. Transparency
5. Removing background (what's referred to as ""alpha masking"")
6. Converting from one file type to another
7. Reducing file size
8. Shrinking images to fit a specific pixel-by-pixel constraint
9. Layering text onto an image
10. Combining multiple images into a single image
11. Adding drop-shadows to images
12. Changing background colors of an image

Since converting converting to Mac, I've grown to love Aperture for storing and ""editing"" photos.  It is great for adjusting exposure, white balance, etc.  However, it does not do any of the things I mentioned in my list above (other than file resizing and exporting).  This is where a program like Pixelmator comes in.  Yes, Photoshop can do all this stuff (and arguably do it better than Pixelmator).  However, the learning curve for Photoshop is incredibly daunting (just watch someone work in it that uses it every day and it will make your head spin).  The cost is another issue - unless you are doing it for a living, spending $600 or $700 on editing software just doesn't make financial sense.  Again, this is where Pixelmator comes in.

Even though I use it once a month (or sometimes less), I can always accomplish my tasks in Pixelmator within a few minutes, even if it means quickly refreshing my memory by reading the online help or looking at a Youtube video.  It really is easy to learn and use.  Depending on your needs (if they are like mine, for example) it will probably be more than you ever need!  I have never ran into a situation where Pixelmator prevented me from accomplishing a task because of limitations of its feature set.

The program is relatively light weight (doesn't take up gigs of space), and manipulates even large files quickly and easily.  I've opened up 50mb TIFF files and tweaked them, exported them, resized them, etc. without any bogging in my 2007 vintage Macbook Pro.  The program runs even better on my 2009 vintage MBP with 8mb of RAM, but it also ran fine with just 4 MB before I upgraded.

Bottom line, if you are looking for an image editing companion to your normal business software suite - one that will allow you more creative capabilities in your PowerPoint (or Keynote) decks, your  documents, contracts, white papers, etc. then Pixelmator may be the best (and most bang-for-the-buck) alternative on the market.",Great image editing software for people who aren't graphics professionals,False,1335398400,1.0986122886681098,1.0

"I was new to Vista when I received my new laptop, so I wasn't aware of the changing software landscape that seems to be a hallmark of Microsoft products.  Although I did get the Microsoft Office Suite, it now excludes Outlook.  This made me very, very angry.

When the opportunity to review this latest incarnation of Outlook came along, I jumped at it, because life post-Outlook is pretty awful. And, now that I'm back in the warm bosom of Microsoft's email program, I can breathe a sigh of relief.

This is the same Outlook you either love or hate.  The programs still seem to be developed independently of each other. There's also junk email scanning which is semi-useful if you don't have spam blocking on your server side. The Reading Pane is omnipresent but removable and there's this irritating tendency to group messages into, well, groups, as if the entire world thought that would be a good idea for message sorting.  News flash: It isn't. Fortunately, it can be turned off.

The calendar is the same as other Outlook calendars, only a little more graphically appealing.  You still cannot easily import data from one of the Outlook programs to the other; dragging and dropping emails preserves body and header.  Similarly, you can drag an email to your contacts, but that only drops the email name into the contacts list and dumps the entire body into Notes field.  In other words, there's no smart way to navigate content between the various sub-programs within Outlook.  This is something that's sorely needed.  The electronic signature at the bottom of emails is becoming the de facto business card, and it'd be nice if we could just import that content right into Contacts.  But alas, Outlook's not about to be THAT innovative.

The other new thing that hangs around, waiting for you to notice it, is the To-Do Bar.  As if navigating the myriad of Outlook programs who don't really like each other wasn't difficult enough, you are now expected to navigate sideways.  From a space perspective, this makes sense; there's more real estate on the horizontal axis of most monitors.  But it is counterintuitive to the rest of the Outlook design, which is top to bottom. The To-Do Bar is basically what used to happen when you clicked on your name in older versions of Outlook: it summarizes all your relevant information in one place. The problem is that it won't go away easily. It eventually goes away if you can figure out how to ask it nicely.  But apparently each application is treated like its own entity, so removing the To-Do Bar from say, email, means it still shows up when you're in Tasks.

Finally there's what's new in this version of Outlook, the Business Contact Manager.  It requires SQL server. This is most useful if you're running a business, and contains everything from projects to accounts, billable hours to marketing campaigns.  It's of particular use to freelancers and hourly consultants; as a consultant myself once, I ended up using the journal to clock my progress, but the BCM can do it better.  Being the new kid on the block, BCM is better integrated with all the other programs.

"Imagine if Microsoft Word crashed every time a period or capital letter was used or when opening saved documents some of the paragraphs appeared twice.  Such is the state of affairs of Microsoft Money 2005.  I have been using Microsoft Money since 1996; while it was never perfect, it basically did what it promised.  I have also used the portfolio manager on the MSN website which is a subset of the Money program with a similar interface. Others have written about problems downloading bank and credit card statements; this review will focus on the portfolio manager.

The portfolio manager is the part of Money that keeps track of investment accounts. It is not unusual for multiple income families to own quite complicated investment portfolios including 401Ks, IRAs and college savings accounts.  Something went very wrong in the fall of 2004 when Microsoft upgraded their software to Money 2005.  Gone is the ability to analyze a single account or groups of accounts; you are forced to analyze your entire portfolio.  When entering new equity transactions, Money used to allow you to simply enter the trading symbol and it would quickly find the name of the company and other information, now you must follow a wizard and enter the information manually.  Previously, you could enter a back dated transaction and it would guess a price using the closing price for the day (this is very useful for watch accounts); now you must manually enter the information.

The worse part has been the removal of the associated cash accounts.  I never really appreciated the separate cash accounts until Microsoft removed them.  For those unfamiliar with software, here is the basic concept.  Say you own an account with a discount broker like Fidelity or Vanguard that holds six mutual funds.  Associated with that account is a cash account in which you add and remove cash, collect dividends and conduct other transactions into and out of the account.  When you sell a mutual fund, the proceeds are put into the cash account; similarly, cash is taken from the account when you buy shares of an investment.  Prior versions of Money created a distinct cash account associated with a specific investment account.  You could open the account, view the transaction history and correct any errors.  In Money 2005, when you create a new account it simply asks for the initial cash balance.  Money then automatically mismanages this account by recording dividends twice and mishandling sales proceeds.  Furthermore, money will not allow you to record interest dividends, contributions or redemptions.  There is no way to view the history at all; Money simply gives you the current value in a little box.  When errors occur, the fix from Microsoft is to simply change the amount in the little box to the correct value.  If you access the cash account too often it begins to create multiple cash accounts labeled #2, #3 leading to cash account nightmare.

Microsoft did an upgrade to the software this weekend (May 20, 2005).  They have added more features and unfortunately more bugs; I have not noticed anything that has been fixed.  New problems include: 1) updates are no longer stored on the MSN server preventing you from accessing up-to-date account information from multiple computers (this may be a temporary problem); 2) investments that lack a trading symbol, such as specialty funds available through certain 401Ks or 529 plans, are no longer supported.  You can see the investment in your portfolio but you cannot record ""buys"" or other transactions; 3) information contained in watch accounts, such as year-to-date performance was lost after the upgrade.

I hope once Microsoft is finished adding features to their Money 2005 software they will work on bringing it from Alpha to Beta quality.  Perhaps, after a year or two of Beta testing, Microsoft will be ready to release Money 2005 (or 2008) for general sale.  Until then, I do not see how they can legally be selling software that fails to perform its basic functions.",Not Ready For Beta Testing,False,1116806400,2.7080502011022096,0.0

"When I purchased this security protection for the coming year, I never expected it to be so far behind all the others that I've ever used. Firstly, upon receiving the disc in the mail, I initiated an immediate FULL SCAN just to be sure that there were no major threats to start. When the FULL SCAN was completed, 5 nasty Trojan viruses were reported as present. To remove them, the (AVG) program declared that the program must reboot to complete the scan process. But when the ""day 2"" FULL scan was performed, just to double check the thorough process of the first scan, the same viruses were identified as ""present & accounted for, sir!"". That's troubling news when I've maintained sufficient anti-virus protection to this PC without a pause. Then, this program (allegedly) finds major threats, completes the scan-&-reboot to remove them, and promptly fails the test of a true good anti-virus security protection to complete what it's meant to do--take out the bad threats & remove the problems!
I can only guess but I would surmise that most PC users would find an AVG FULL SCAN, which requires a reboot, to complete its so-called removal, to be unacceptably time-consuming & grossly inefficient (i.e. especially when the reboot-removal doesn't do what it supposed to do! Other Anti-virus programs remove threat problems by two major & primary means: 1. deletion <OR> 2. Quarantine. This one does neither as an option to handle such threats!!
A PC reboot which doesn't accomplish the scan process to remove a virus threat is neither a practical nor efficient means of Anti-virus security software. In summary, I rate this brand of Internet Security protection as a ""1"" just to be kind. It's too ineffective to be regarded seriously as worthy of prime consideration for a year of major PC security protection.

"The 2009 release 'Land of the Lost' is yet another film in a long line of films whose success or failure is dependent on Will Ferrell's ability to entertain the audience.

""Land of the Lost' contains all the expected elements found in a Will Ferrell movie; lots of slapstick and physical comedy, moments of surprisingly inappropriate material for the adolescent members of the audience and of course large doses of Will's character (i.e.: Dr. Rick Marshall) rambling on in a narcissistic frenzy about his personal greatness and unrecognized genius. With these egotistical pontifications so prevalent in all of his films one must eventually begin to wonder just how much of this behavior is extracted from real life?

These tables are all fun to play; even the older ""Lost World"" table. ""Lost World"" has no background music however, which may be realistic, but it does sound empty compared to the others, which all have full music soundtracks.

 And speaking of sound, the digital effects are all astounding, except for when the ball hits against a non-scoring item, like a side rail or a corner post.

"I have been using Ubuntu since Vista first came out and never looked back. However I only install LTS versions because I know they are stable and will be supported the longest. When I installed the last LTS (12.04 LTS), I purchased the DVD from LinuxFreak.  I could have gotten it free by ordering it from Ubuntu, but that takes quite awhile to receive it. So I ordered it from Amazon.com and got it in two days. To me the cost is nominal. So I decided to again order from LinuxFreak via Amazon.com. I know that I might still have a problem, so to be safe I always back up everything twice to an external drive, once with a backup program and then I copy the ""home"" folder to the external drive. I also export bookmarks, etc. ""just in case"". Then I connect to internet using wired connection (ethernet) and I make sure the laptop is fully charged and plugged in. Then it is a simple act of putting the DVD in that ends up never being simple. I had to get into bios to have it boot from the CD/DVD drive instead of the harddrive. That took many attempts to get to that configuration screen instead of constantly bringing up the current Ubuntu operating system. That problem has nothing to do with Ubuntu; in my case it is a Dell problem. Once that works, there are only a few screens. The paperwork (one sheet of paper) that comes with the DVD is all one needs for instructions. I make sure to check 2 boxes on the screen, get the updates while installing and install the 3rd party software. And since I am upgrading and don't have Windows, I select upgrade when it sees that I have Ubuntu 12.04 installed. You can select to replace Windows if it sees that you have Windows or have it so that you keep Windows and also have Ubuntu. You can also use the DVD to boot from and just try out Ubuntu. It went through the whole process and it seemed to be a successful installation, but when after removing the DVD and it restarted, it came up with some kind of error (file missing or something). So I reloaded the DVD. It saw that I had Ubuntu 14.04 and asked did I want to reinstall totally or do I want to reinstall while keeping my documents, etc. I chose the latter and it went through the whole process again. But this time when it restarted after installation, it was just fine. I only had a few apps and programs that were removed because they were downlevel for 14.04, but I just searched for them from the software center and got the versions for 14.04. Some had enhanced functions in the later release, so that was good. Bottom line, everything you need to either try Ubuntu out or to install it is that DVD and the instructions sheet.

Kaito V3 comes with Studio One (a Digital Audio Workstation) and the vst Piapro Studio. His voicebanks can be used within Piapro Studio, but I highly recommend buying the V3/V4 editor first as I feel like they are much more stable and simpler to use in general.

Kaito V3 comes with 4 voicebanks; ""Whisper"", ""Soft"", ""English"", and his core ""Straight"" voicebank.
Compared to his V1, he is generally softer. higher, and more nasally in tone. His voicebanks are pretty decent in quality,
but they aren't very versatile. He has a very limited vocal range and can't sing high. Generally, Kaito V3 works best with soft ballad/rock type songs, but his Straight and English can also be used for pop. I find his Soft voicebank to be the most pleasant in tone. With the VOCALOID 4 editor, cross synthesizing his Soft and Straight voicebanks can give you the best results. His English can be a bit weird at times, but with editing, its one of the better English Vocaloid3 voicebanks available. If you are looking for a more deep, solid and masculine type vocal, I would highly recommend you getting either Gackpoid or VY2V3 instead. Overall, Kaito V3 can get the job done, but I wouldn't recommend him as your first Vocaloid just because of how limited he is.","Not very versatile but what he can do, he does well.",True,1392336000,1.0986122886681098,1.0
"All issues with the Cloud Drive platform feature set aside this application is buggy, or the backing service is buggy.

It does not handle large files. I tried uploading a 30GB disk image and it never actually completed. I checked the log and it would continually cancel the transaction or would fail once all the data had been uploaded. The application itself does not show the status of a single upload, so it just keeps chugging along uploading and failing endlessly. In either case I spent well over a week trying to upload one file over and over again.

Uploading folders full of small files is a little better, but there still seem to be a large amount of upload failures (retrying...) even for small files. This makes me worry that some of my files may end up getting skipped as there is no way to verify all the files have been uploaded. The web user interface provides no way to get a count of files and folders under a given directory.

The service as a would be a economical way to store data and nostalgia that I don't access all the frequently, which is why I can put up with the lack of a sync feature.

"Let me first say that fhe idea with this program is great. Both professionals and amateurs will find it useful as a practice tool. However ...

I bought BIB first time 2012 and my original review can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R122W54PEHH5FC/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B006MBZXJO&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=229534&store=software

I had hoped that at least some of the core of my complaints/wishes should have been addressed and rewritten three years late but to my disappointment most of my original critique is still valid. Yes there have been some minor clean up in the UI but not the complete rewrite it really requires. The UI is still extremely bad. The target audience are professional and amateur (me) musicians and as such we know music but the idiosyncrasies of the UI forces me to spend more time on the UI than on the music. Given that I am a professional software developer since the last 30 years who have worked with a lot of bad tools with even worse UIs its quite a big feat to have me upset by a UI (of course adding icons that looks like designed by a kid doesn't help)

Unfortunately there are, to the best of my knowledge, no alternatives so we are stuck with a program + UI that seems more designed by a hobbyist twenty years ago rather than a professional software company in 2015. This is the only reason for three stars. With a single viable alternative it would be one star.

Pros:
- Using the realtracks with the right settings can produce fairly to very good backup/band sound
- Great for practicing mechanical timing, much more fun and effective  than a metronome
- The only program in its genre
- The core program is fairly priced (but keep in mind you need to invest in a number of real-track packs to really be able to get good sound so you probably have to double the initial cost, depending on what kind of variety you need/want)

Cons:
- Bad , bad , bad UI. BTW did I mention the horribly UI?
- Manages to avoid every single de-facto standard UI-pattern in Windows (and Mac) so nothing is were you reasonable can expect it
- Expect to invest heavily in learning the program (weeks rather than days)
- Confusing docs written like a really dense text book and difficult to use as a reference. Also the layout and typography of the docs indicates to me that this was not written by a professional + the use of music slang rather than proper music terms makes it far less than optimal.
- I experienced a few program crashes with some cryptic error messages which again indicates a lot of legacy code with error messages looking like early VB windows messages.

Unfortunately, the last three years lack of real progress, as far as I can judge, the market material indicates a lot of improvements but to the naked eye and daily use there is very few changes apart from some minor UI-cleanups. Perhaps more advanced users can spot the improvements. From this I'm forced to draw the conclusion that the company does not have the competency or the financing it takes to bring this program into this millennium and instead are forced to make only minor improvements (to justify a new version and bring in revenues - which I can understand from a business point of view). The program has what is known development circles as a intractable technical debt that sadly will never be paid. A pity, since the whole idea with the program is absolutely great. Just poorly executed.

"The claims that this software is of equal quality to Rosetta Stone are just ludicrous. The software is comparable only in that it aims for the same goal: teaching people a new language. The method is where Rosetta Stone shines, and it is in the method where the two programs quickly diverge.

- As another reviewer noted, this software is all made to run directly from the disc, not installed on the hard drive. This is unfortunate for a couple reasons:
  * the software runs slower as reading from a disc is more time intensive than reading from the hard drive
  * it is a significant drain on the battery

"I have used the older version of Calendar Creator since it came out. It was GREAT!!! Of course, it no longer works with windows7, so I had to buy an updated version. I worried that with ""improvements"" it would be worse. I was right. It seems like it is PRETTIER (you have more choices for art, colors, fonts, etc.) but less functional. I cannot modify margins within days, I cannot view the week with smaller weekend blocks (the first version even did that.) and some other things. For example listing more than 5 or 6 events in one day pushes them off the bottom (due to unchangable spacing between lines), I could fit them on my old calendar program by choosing ""small"". Now, if I try to make the font smaller, it ~could~ work, but there is no way to hit ""enter"" within the event, so it is one continuous block of text. Try lining THAT up using the space bar!) There used to be commands (like &line) which no longer exist.

I realize my needs aren't exactly the same as someone elses. I USED to like that so much of the basics were modifiable with the old program. This one is too ""template-y""...there are just not enough things for me to be able to modify. I mean...i don't really care if I can change the shadow under something. I use the calendar to view events efficiently...not so much to be pretty.  I mean, templates and pre-designed things are great...but give me a choice to NOT use them if I want.

A better program would have pre-designed choices AND a blank page that still accessed a calendar (for repeating events) where you could make days any size you want...and make the event box like a REAL text box (where you could bold or underline partial text, etc.) Say for example, you work wednesdays through fridays, maybe you would like those days wider on your calendar to accommodate more text. OR if you have 15 things to do on one day, you should be able to view and print that (even if it is small) not just click some arrow on your computer. This isn't that kind program.  :(

"Many of us have been disappointed and genuinely angry about Windows Vista: it has useless features, complexities and problems that make its use more than a problem. The reaction has ranged from ""can I return this to the manufacturer"" to passive frustration in near silence and now to ""there's a solution out there called Windows 7... and it could not be worse than Vista... and maybe it's better"".

Many of us also pay for extended warranty protection and both hardware and software support. I am one of those buyers who has tended to pay extra amounts up front to ""protect my investment"" and hopefully make the use of my laptops less difficult and more problem free, knowing that the up front cost can be steep and ""problem free"" a rare and temporary state of affairs.

This is the case with a Dell laptop (Model XPS M1530) I purchased in the last year and for which paid the substantial additional cost of a supplemental warranty and service contract extending through 2011 for the laptop/hardware, software and the extended support. Last week I finally decided after considerable deliberation to purchase Windows 7 and through Dell's live on-line service communicated with an engineering service representative who was more than delighted to sell me the Windows 7 package, which comes in various ""strengths"" and hence at various price points.

I had done some homework on the Microsoft website which had what appeared to be slightly lower costs but made the decision to buy from Dell keeping my purchases within the ""sphere"" of Dell and its contractual performance obligations. The Dell sales person told me to contact Dell when I received the discs and that they would help me to install the ""custom"" version of the software. When I attempted to seek their help several days later they informed me that their ""help"" on installation would cost me $129 per hour, which was not disclosed up front.

Even worse Dell has subsequently informed that because I purchased the software from ""Dell Retail"", a ""separate company"" my warranty coverage on the laptop's operating system is no longer in effect and that I must now pay $129 per hour for support relating to software problems... a loss of warranty and a cost that was never disclosed to me. So not only did I lose value from the original extended service contract but I paid $340 for the Windows 7 software that will now cause me to pay service fees I was never informed of.

I put all this out there as a warning to those who may be confronting the same decision. Dell's lack of disclosure may well violate Massachusetts Consumer Protection laws as well as those in New York and California. Even if it does not constitute violation of any laws it demonstrates a ""way of doing business"" that is deplorable, disgusting and foul. Many of us don't mind paying additional sums for good perforamnce and service but we do not like material information withheld from us an any point especially when we are making a purchase decision.

I lost the discs for the old Word Perfect and refused to spend a lot for a new set.  Which meant that I had no real convenient way of accessing the old files. Then in comes this wonderful deal.  This is more high tech than the last one I  have.  It merges my WordPerfect docs seamlessly with my Word docs.

"I originally purchased the Cook'n program to replace an old cooking software program, Gourmet Cooking as that program would not work on Windows 7 or 8. The Cook'n program has proven to be just what I was looking for. I am 76 years old and enjoy cooking and used to have lots of cookbooks, probably 35 to 40. I now use only the Cook'n program and use it to research and develop my own computer recipe files. I started collecting computer recipe files in the early days on Food Network TV and I still have lots of floppy disks with the Food Network Chefs recipes. In those days you could send Food Network 1 dollar and they would mail you a copy of a selected recipe or you could download it for free which I did but they were not organized. I subscribed to Bon Appetite from day one of their publication and also such magazines such as Southern Living. I found that cookbooks and magazines were bulky and difficult to use, Cook'n solved this issue. I now have purchased 7 copies of the Cook'n program and have given them as gifts to friends and relatives. The program specifications does not show Windows 8 as being compatible but I use Windows 8 and it works fine.

"IF you are a Quicken user then I would expect that you would like this product very well. I am coming from Microsoft Money Premium, and thus, have found the product not as much to my liking in comparison, but now there is no other option. This version ""Rental Property Manager"" appears to be Quicken's most comprehensive version having all the features of the other versions (a strange name for the ""top of the line"" version)."" However, I was interested in the most comprehensive version and thus bought the Rental Property Manager at twice the cost of the Microsoft Money Premium that I used prior. To be totally fair, I'm sure this is a fine product, but, for some of us that used the Money product, there is a clear separation, especially, using it as an ""investment management"" tool along with some other financial tracking features. It seems a bit more ""basic"" in its presentation, graphic, and financial analysis structure, more like a variation built on Microsoft Excel. I chose not to use the automatic conversion process due to other comments. I am reloading the data manually so as not to create any ongoing issues due to data conversion, Note: I did not use this type of software for electronic banking prior so that was/is not my objective, which, is more of its first line intent. I couldn't get to a live person to resolve initial questions, had to email, then got back a response, then you can set an appointment to talk with a customer service representative on a scheduled event. Like many things in life, sometimes what might be the better product does not win in the world of ""marketing and sales"" but we must all adjust, use what is available to us, or at some point someone will be driven to create a better product.

I'd prefer MS Money if I could have it, but I'll readjust and move on since that is the option available currently.

Moneydance has an intuitive user interface, powerful home page area that gives me a quick overview of my finances and budget, reminders so I don't forget payments, online banking and bill pay, and a number of powerful graphs and reports.  It also has a mobile app that I can use on my iPhone for quickly entering transactions while I'm out, which syncs effortlessly over Dropbox wherever I am. So awesome!

"As many of the reviews of this product make plain, TurboTax changed their software packaging for the 2014 tax season, and no longer walk you through Schedules C and D in their Deluxe version, as they had been doing for many years.  Now, you have to purchase this Personal and Small Business version, at a higher price.  I've used TurboTax many times in the past, and have never had a problem with it, and the 2014 version is no exception.  It installed easily and ran smoothly on my old XP desktop, and did what I needed.
But, over the years I've used other tax preparation software, too, and haven't been unhappy with it.  I've used what used to be called Tax Cut several times, which is now H&R Block, and have had no problems.  H&R Block's Deluxe package includes federal and state returns and includes Schedules C and D, for half the price of TurboTax Personal and Small Business.

"This is an excellent game and you too can get it running on your computer. Oregon Trail 5 should run on any version of Windows made in the past 20 years. The 5th edition is simply a modified version of Oregon Trail II. I've tested this on several computers without much trouble. 32 bit/64 bit, it doesn't matter.

You can play Oregon Trail without the CD which seems to correct a lot of the problems with install and running properly. I've created steps as detailed as possible below. Any average computer user should be able to follow these steps, just follow along one step at a time. I'm using quotes to help show what you're looking for, you do not type the quotes out at any point in this tutorial.

1. Open your hard drive so that you are viewing the root of drive C. Your desktop icon ""My Computer"" or ""Computer"" will take you there. Get to ""C:\"" or ""Local Disk C:""

2. Create a new folder and name it ""OT5"". That folder should now have a nice short directory address of C:\OT5. Open that new empty folder and leave that window up for now.

3. Start a new window to open the CD drive folder to view the contents of the Oregon Trail CD. This will typically be drive ""D:"" or ""E:"" on most computers. Do not run setup and do not install the game.

4. You should now be viewing the contents of your CD. Copy the folder called ""data"" on the CD and put it into your newly made OT5 folder on drive C. This will take a minute or so to copy over.

5. After the data folder finishes copying to C:\OT5, go back and view the contents of your CD again. Open the ""Install"" folder and then then ""HD"" folder on the CD. You should see 5 files.

6. Take the entire contents of the ""HD"" folder and copy it to the C:\OT5 folder as well.

7. You should now have 5 files and a data folder in C:\OT5. One of the files is labeled ""OREGON5"". Open this file. Notepad should open it for you. Look for the brackets that say ""[cdrom]""

8. Create a space under the [cdrom] title by hitting the return/enter key - add the text:  ""rsrcpath=C:\ot5\data""

9. This tells the game where to look for the data files. You should now be able to click on the ""OT5"" icon in your newly created folder and run the game properly.

10. No compatibly settings are needed as far as I can tell. You can play with those on the ""OT5"" icon properties menu/compatibility tab if you run into odd playback issues.",Excellent Game - Can run without CD on almost any OS,False,1406764800,2.3978952727983707,1.0

"I had used SM5 basic, but never really got the feeling that it was maintaining my machine. When it's tools did run as scheduled it basically sucked up my system resources and rendered my computer useless until the tasks were completed.

Bought SM6 Pro not too long ago. Initially it would hang while running certain maintenance jobs. Subsequent updates fixed this problem. Overall, I like the ease of use and it feels like the program is keeping my machine tuned up. However, it does so at the expense of performance. It takes programs noticeably longer to open and the tools are not customizable.

The undo function is completely inoperable and the only thing tech support could tell me about it (after contacting them twice and finally getting a reply almost three weeks later) was that they were looking into it and the problem might be fixed in future updates.

Another major problem is that the security program shuts my home network down. I cannot access my main computer from any other computer in the house. The only way to fix this problem is to completely restore my hard drive from a saved image file (or else completely reload the computer from scratch).

SM6 could be a great program. Many of the features and tools are valuable and run well, but the ones that don't wreak too much havoc. Overall, it slows your machine down, does not allow you to customize the way tools run, destroys your network and cannot undo changes it makes to your system.

its been about two weeks now and WIN 8 seems to be growing on me: it is
definitely snappier than 7, shuts down in 10 secs with my SSD, starts up in under
20 seconds and with the upgrade I reclaimed about 15 GB of precious
SSD storage; I've got a Logitech touch pad coming and after I use it with WIN 8
I'll come back and update this review...like others have stated one needs either
a touch mouse or pad or screen to really get the most out of WIN 8

Oh, a word on my upgrade experience is probably in order here..not seemless or flawless
but relatively painless...the upgrade experience gets three stars out of 5; however since
my laptop from Dell is 2 1/2 yrs old in two cases (bluetooth & wifi) the issues
relate to drivers not updated for Win 8 by Dell; Win 8 installed generic drivers in
these cases..audio & video drivers came across just fine, however

Update to follow when I've put some mileage on the Logitech touch pad..

Update:  I have been using the Logitech touch pad (designed for Win8)
for about 12 hrs; it ""significantly"" aids in bringing out the utility
and overall workflow that the designers of win8 had in mind; much like the magic mouse that I use with my macbooks the input devices
now have taken on much more significance utilizing these advanced OS's; WIN 8 update issues have ceased for me (early hangs); I'll keep

"While this software is easy to learn and use, it has a few technical glitches that one should consider before purchasing.

The sharpening tool, while great in Version 9, has been a big disappointment in the last two versions.  I thought that Microsoft would have corrected this after magazine technical reviews pointed this out, but after purchasing this version, I can see that they haven't.

One of the big selling points of this software is the ease in which one can create projects....magazine covers, cards, framed pictures etc.  However, one should be aware that not all of these features work fine with all photo files.  After adding a photo to a Magazine cover, for example, and saving the file in the .png format, upon reopening the file, sometimes the photo is fuzzy and highly digitized.  ( The automatic resizing doesn't always work correctly.  When this happen, an acceptable workaround, to some, is to save the file in a jpeg format.  You then have a flattened file that you cannot make changes to after saving, but at least the pictures are clear when reopening to print another copy.)

Other than these problems, the software itself is pretty good for the most part; the short learning curve, ease of use and the large array of project templates make it one the best on the market in this price range.",Buyer Beware of a Few Glitches,False,1132099200,4.110873864173311,1.0

"Product with elusive fix: 1 star
Product after fix: 5 stars

I had problems h the product on Windows 7. The fix is not fully intuitive unless you have a fair bit of experience in IT. The problem is due to the program not having the ability to write to its own database if the user using it is not an administrator. I was unable to find a fix for this and ended up giving my daughter full administrator rights... not what I wanted to do, but it got the program to work (it was on her personal computer). I made a few phone calls to customer service over a more than a week week and received no callback. I decided to make a little noise and as a result, I was able to be pointed toward a knowledge base article that gave a procedure to fix the issue, allowing me to remove administrative rights for my daughter. I had already looked through the knowledge base, but this item was never shown to me since it was only listed under a listing for all of Type To Learn 4 products (I looked under the home version - the version that I purchased). I found its lack of being included within an applicable version's listing to be quite disappointing. I told the person to whom I spoke about the issue and he said that he would get it resolved.

Here is a link to the knowledge base article:

Unfortunately, the default option of not allowing the children to progress to the next level without getting a perfect score may prove to be frustrating for many children so it may be wise to allow them to progress and let them go back to increase their score.

"We installed this product at home as an addition to our son who has studied CAD in high school and we hoped this would be a great help at a more reasonable cost than AutoCAD. As avid and above average computer users and troubleshooting skills large capability products like this don't normally worry him.

Here is the review he put together in the viewpoint of a student/CAD user.

===Install===
The installation itself, was as others noted, a bit difficult.  Errors would appear.  I quickly did a search and also read other Amazon reviews and saw the simple solution to use the shortcut it installs in the program directory and to reboot before closing the final error that appeared.  CorelCad launched great from there.  The lack of documentation that comes with the install CD is disturbing as noted by others.

I definitely did not like the way there were so many sub folders it defaulted to and changing some of them was tedious.  I would have preferred if it simply asked on installation to take their defaults or let me pick.  We ran a test install on both WIndows and Mac to be fair since it ran on both.  I ended up running this on a PC inside of VMWare Fusion on the Mac to be honest.

Now my machine is not slow by any means but this program seemed to take a long time to launch and do certain actions.  I hope it is just because of how complex the software capabilities are but make sure you have a powerful machine (way above what they tell you on the box)

===Features and function===
I loved the capabilities this offered.  Pretty much everything I could think of was there. Finding where in the menu or toolbars was a learning experience like any new software.  It would be cool if there was a menu to turn it down to ""light"" mode and reduce the options for simple drawing and then an ""advanced"" mode. This would increase the speed in learning curve or let you jump all the way in right away.

I created numerous drawings with various levels of complexity. The 3D modeling is great and awesome at such a price for this software.

The ability to read AutoCAD files and even export them made it easy to work with classroom stuff I needed to get done at home. So bonus points for that ability for all students and those needing to see AutoCAD files.

===Summary===
A great buy and an even better pricing for anyone needing this type of drawing power at home.  With the ability to run on PC or Mac it reduces more limitations.  Just make sure you have sufficient hardware to run it.  Be patient on launch but then it performed well.  I did not have crashes like others mention in any testing.  Also if you are unfamiliar with CAD software in general expect a few minutes to learn something new.  Explore with test drawings. Create new stuff.  You cant break it making drawings. If complexity is the complaint then more exploration is needed.  It lack of documentation is the complaint I fully agree.  They really need to add more demos and help files.

I give it 4 of five due to the issue with installation and the lack of good help files.  The rest rocks and I am glad I got this to work more at home on my CAD

===Updates===
NOTE: The new CorelCad 2013 update has documentation on the website and much of it can be helpful as long as you are not worried about it referring to a new feature you may not have.

The latest version (2.505) has added several valuable new  functions, including synchronization of only changed items (which speeds up  synchronization), and an optional feedback panel that shows what is being  synchronized as it happens.

"Norton has almost always been my favorite security program. I began using it in 1990 when it was Norton Commander - a menu system for DOS -  and stuck with it through almost all its incarnations. At some point, maybe seven or eight years ago, it became bloated and I began using free products, which worked fine without slowing the computer to a crawl - but I missed the full scans and features in Norton that I always found so trustworthy.

Six years ago, I switched to a Mac and didn't go back to Norton. I used nothing for a while since Macs are less likely to be hacked, but that made me very nervous. I installed the free version of Avast and used it until a Mac-savvy friend who was trying to speed my old Mac back up told me I really needed Norton for Mac. (Indeed there was a disk-filling virus in that machine that only Norton was able to catch - Avast was unaware of it.) He told me to run full scans regularly - not just the quickies - and I did that, too.)

When I got a new Mac earlier this year, my Norton was expiring so I went back to Avast for a while. It's good - it caught a virus, in fact, and does a lot of what Norton does - but it slows the computer considerably.  Now I have Norton in my new Mac and things are running very smoothly. The days of bloat are gone. Norton runs fast and clean and even the in-depth scans don't take too long - or slow the machine perceptibly.

I started using TurboTax in 2002 and have used it every year since. As my tax situation has grown more complicated with investments and a business, it has more than met my needs. It is easy-to-use, complete, and hassle-free.

I take comfort in knowing that it doesn't overlook deductions, credits, or expenses. Once I have gone through the interview process (which is ridiculously simple), I know I have touched all the bases.

"I bought TaxCut this year instead of TurboTax, after finding out about the debacle they brought upon themselves. This reminded me why I switched to TT in the first place. While it was reasonably smooth to use, there were a couple of things that drove me a bit batty -- mostly having to do with a correction I was supposed to make. I had money withheld from my paycheck for dependent care, but ended up not paying all of it out for one reason or another. TaxCut seemed to want me to account for it all, rather than letting it expire unpaid.
However, once everything was straightened out, filing was easy: most of the forms and worksheets were straightforward, and it was not a problem that I kept backtracking as more documents came in. The e-file was easy to do, as well.
Backing up my return at the end was more difficult than I wanted, too, but I managed.

"Photo Plus x4 is listed at $20.99 in the Amazon store, but the download version is listed at $79.99. I would be careful about what you are paying for the product, which incidentally, I have just purchased after extensively researching all the major competitively priced photo editing suites, like Adobe Elements6 (the older version, as is Photo Plus x4). The program is definitely worth the $79.99 price, but at $21, it simply can't be beat.

I have been using the free Gimp2 for some time now, and while it is a very powerful editor, and is free, it does not have many of the  great qualities of Photo Plus x4, which does everything from simple instant photo repair, to in depth tasks such as removing unwanted  artifacts simply an easily. (hint, I watched Serif's video, and was extremely impressed, and I have used Adobe Elements)

For those who want to do simple photo improvements like fixing 'red eye' to more complex tasks using masks and layers, Photo Plus x4 will satisfy those who have no experience in photo editing, to semi-pros.

"Basically, you need Windows Internet Explorer to do business transactions with, e. g., certain car insurance companies. If you are not using Internet Explorer from Microsoft when you go to these web sites, they will tell you they can't do business with you. So, that makes recent Windows some kind of a must have for your pc.

If you object to becoming part of their cloud for, say, privacy reasons, and you manage to install Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 using the old-fashioned Windows 7 local, non-cloud password, that will work. But Microsoft recently decreed that you must use the Microsoft cloud name/password to log in to the apps on your computer. That is my idea of invasion of privacy, although lots of people think that going around with all kinds of dissimilar name and password pairs in your mind is perfectly all right, and doesn't constitute an imposition and needless clutter. (This ""decree"" at the moment appears to strike Intel DN2800 desktop machines that use this OEM DVD, and not machines that downloaded the Windows 8.1 update after installing Windows 8 from a DVD.

"I have used editing software for over 10 years and this is by far the worst program i have ever used.  It looks nice. The clip art is lovely.  However, I have just spent hours preparing a flier for a charity project only to have the program delete ALL text and clip art upon saving (using the ""save as"" feature).  This is not a fluke as it has now done this to me four (4) times.  I finally had to print it out and will have to photo copy it rather than print or e-mail it from here as it has deleted my information again.  If i hit the save button at the bottom of the screen it will save but you can not change the name of the file that way, so that would be very inconvient.

In the past i have used several programs, Print Master Platnium (which i lost the disks for and should have just replaced instead of buying this software), American Greeting Cards (which is attiquite), and Photoshop (nice but not really for this application).

Just a side note you also need a lot of excess mouse clicks to get to menu options.  Rather than having font, color, and effects having quick short menus that you can one-click standard options every change has to go into a full menu.  This keeps your working area clean and nice looking, but is time consuming.  Also you can not ""shift group"" all of your text and change the font or color in one group. It has to be individually changed or temporarily grouped and then ungrouped which take a lot of extra wasted time.  A small matter but tidious.  Definately not a reason to not buy this product but a matter to concider when weighing two equally good products.

On the positive side the clip art is really very nice and there seems to be more than i could ever use, which i love.  It also has plenty of fonts to choose from.  I have just bought this software today but the 3D craft projects and the mini albums look like they would be fun to try.  Other than deleting all my work when I tried to save the program is fairly easy to just sit down and use.

I often skip 1 star ratings but please be careful before putting out this much money when other programs work very well.  If you do not mind having to never use the save as function then this may very well be a great program for you.

"Let's be real, we all have dozens of kid movies on DVD we would like to digitize. These were bought before digital copies were even an option. (If there was a service you could pay 4 or 5 dollars to do this I would use the service)
I bought this to copy all of the kids Disney movies. Disney makes security very hard to bypass and I don't have the computer skills for some of the ""ripping and burning"" that the web says will work.
Plug the Roxio into your DVD player and the USB into your computer. After download and install of software put a DVD into your DVD player. The video will appear as input. Use your remote to cue the disc to the beginning. Set the record time based on the length of running time on the DVD box. (I always add a minute or two in case I am not in the room when it ends). Just before the movie begins click the record button and let it go. Since you are copying you have to let it play the entire movie to copy it. (Like when you would copy a cassette from a friend in the old days)
When the movie ends press Stop button and it Finishes in a few seconds.  Click the arrow to Export, select your device and click export. Processing takes almost as long as watching the movie. So in a sense you are running each movie twice to get it converted to digital. Our family has 3 ipads so I Export to iTunes. I think it is helpful to have iTunes open before you start.

Now you have a mp4 which I also keep on an external hard drive. I have already done about 80 movies. I plan to buy a MyCloud from WD so I can hopefully stream all of these movies from anywhere the kids have WiFi.
All in all a good product for the price. That in this day and age it takes 3 hours to ""copy"" a movie seems a bit long but once you copy a few it pays for itself pretty quick.
Disney is coming out with an upgrade service where if you still have the receipt from one of their movies and it is on their list you will be able to pay for a digital copy, but I think you have to surrender the DVD so where's the gain.
You will figure a routine like start a movie before bed and export it when you wake up. In that way you can do 30 in a month and in no time you'll have your entire collection copied...",Copying all the kids Disney movies!,False,1395792000,0.0,1.0

"I was a die-hard Pinnacle (then AVID) fan and if I had a new computer I would probably still be using Pinnacle or Avid or now Pinnacle again. But it just got sooooo sloooowwww that I went looking for a new video editor instead of a new computer.

Here's what happened - Corel VideoStudio x6 wouldn't even install so that one went by the boards. I had a look at Sony and even a cracked version of Adobe Premiere Pro (which would be my choice if I did video editing for a living), Adobe Premiere Elements, Magix  and a few others but eventually decided to give Cyberlink a harder look after fooling around with the demo. I was glad I did.

I edit video infrequently but when I do, I just want to combine my clips, put some music and a few cool transitions and titles in it and not have to re-learn the software to do it. Or wait painfully for the software to catch up to my edits (In Pinnacle, it had to turn the little clock on to just re-draw the timeline and it go soo painful to watch)

Cyberlink was easy to learn, the right click context menus are excellent (do you want to overwrite or move all these clips to the right etc. etc.) and while this would get wearying if you did it day in and day out, when you want to just do some editing, it will give you guidance without having to relearn the software and it  just allows you to get the job done. Sometimes simpler is better.

It also comes with an excellent ""ebook"" that if you go through it, you can pick up the features really quick. There's also a lot of chance for tweaking all kinds of effects and edits if you're a power user but if you're like me and don't really need to do a lot, you can just jump in the software and go.

But there's more - when I upgraded my AMD Asus moterhboard to the 8350 8 core CPU from my Phenom 4-core, Cyberlink just loved it. Things get done right now. There is no waiting. So I also went back to my Avid Studio software to see what would happen with it. Nothing that you would notice. Still painfully slow.

If you value speed, ease of use, lots of features if you really want them, a great user interface, a shallow learning curve and not having to wait for your video editor to think about things too much, I would go with Cyberlink. Works for me.","Compared it to to ALL the ""prosumer"" suites",False,1388448000,0.0,1.0

"Amazing how MS has people spamming the product ratings here. The bottom line is when this software was released it was *extremely* buggy and Microsoft even acknowledged many of these bugs online, in public fora. They since have made several bugs fixes and a few performance tweaks and the product is more stable as a result, but still not as stable as it should be for public use. Take it from someone who tests major league commercial software applications on a regular basis: there is NO EXCUSE for MS releasing a product that was this poorly tested. The Mac Development team at MS is very small compared to other teams and they are resource starved, so it's less the developers themselves then careless policy on the part of MS management. Were they to put more of their considerable resources into developing this product it would be released on a more regular schedule and likely with better results.

Most of the five star reviews here are either totally bogus, or written by people who write 1 page Word Documents and send email, thinking that makes them qualified to comment on the performance of the whole suite of applications and functionalities. Ask any hard-core Office 2004 user (someone who uses all the apps on a weekly basis) what they think about Office 2008 and the response is almost guaranteed to be negative. For some the only reason to update is that Office 2004, when used on Intel Macs, is really slow compared to older PPC Macs (which Office 2004 was designed for). So for some speed may make this a requirement, but don't expect smooth sailing; choppy seas are ahead until the next major update arrives.

Even at this stage (June 2008) this product is late-beta quality IMO. Almost ready for prime-time. By the time the second major update rolls around, it will be what it should have been from the start. Buying this product by the end of Summer 2008, should be a much safer bet for people.

"I bought the YNAB software after reading recommendations and it had become available for Mac. It has changed my approach to handling my personal spending and in managing my own business bottom line. I am learning to let money sit, unspent, in my pocket or my bank accounts. I am learning to think whether expenditures fit within my income now--- or if I should wait for later, or not spend at all. I am seriously enjoying this process! The help offered online, in tutorials and in the forums, is important for those of us budget-challenged.

I had used Quicken in the past; it didn't help me decide what to do with my income; YNAB makes it clear to see where the money is going and perhaps even to improve how much of it I can hang on to.

"I downloaded Kaspersky because it was recommended to me by a personal friend. Not only was the software outdated, slow, ineffective at defending my Windows 10 PC on several occasions, it also is sadly behind with updates compared to other Antivirus Security Options available for comparable prices.

Now, I just wasted 3 hours of my life on the phone with Kaspersky's ""Customer Service"". I was at my computer trouble shooting at the same time I as on hold and found a live chat option. I figured, what the heck, I'm waiting anyways I'll see if I can get someone on live chat. So I did. The person on live chat gave me a link that didn't work at first, the second one he sent provided me with software I could download that would completely remove Kaspersky. However, I did not get this second link that allowed me to download the effective software until I got so frustrated with the incompetent woman on the phone I hung up on her. She would repeat what I said back to me for no reason, so I know that she could hear me just fine. Not only that, I'm on Wi-Fi calling, so... there is no ""cutting in and out"". I could hear her perfectly fine. When she repeatedly attempted telling me that because Kaspersky was not showing up on the list of my ""Remove Programs"" list via my control panel option that it had already been removed from the PC. I told her that this indeed was not the case. There were several reasons I knew this, Windows Defender would not work, because Kaspersky wouldn't let it, also, it showed up in file explorer. She continued to try and convince me that because it wasn't listed under the ""Uninstall List"" that is could not be on the PC. At this point I ask politely (By the way, I have been nothing but %100 polite with this woman) to speak to a supervisor. To this she replies ""I am sorry sir, you are breaking up."" I can hear her completely fine. I have all bars full on my iPhone 6S Plus WITH WIFI CALLING. So a repeat myself, slower, not condescendingly ""May I please speak with your supervisor?"" She replies ""I'm sorry sir, you seem to be breaking up and I can not hear you."" Which I know is complete baloney. This goes on for around five to ten minutes until she puts me on hold. I held for about four minutes, she comes back on the line and says that ""All of our supervisors are currently on a call"" (This is utter and total BS.) She then reassures me (I am about a year away from graduating from UWG with a Computer Science Degree, btw.) that she can assist me with anything that any of her supervisors could. I ask her what my next step should be. She tells me to click on the icon on my desktop called ""This Computer"". I inform her that there is no icon named that. I suggest I open file explorer. She tells me this is not the same thing. She has been hearing me just fine since she got back on the line, by the way. Naturally, when she tells me that I won't be able to find what I'm looking for in ""File Explorer"" I once again, ask for a supervisor. Her reply: ""I am sorry sir, you are cutting out, could you repeat that?"" I repeat myself. ""I'm sorry sir, we seem to have a bad connection."" Me: ""May I PLEASE speak with your supervisor?"" Her: ""I am sorry sir, I can not hear you, we seem to have a bad connection."" I know she can hear me. I tell her this. She says ""I'm sorry sir, we seem to have a bad connection because I can not hear you."" So at this point I am beyond irate. Also, by this point, I have found removal software on my own on the internet and have removed the useless software. I reboot and thank god Kaspersky (better named un-deletable demon software) is finally gone. I open Windows Defender, all is good and I run an update and full scan, everything is kosher. I tell miss (kicking myself for not getting her name) that while she was wasting my time claiming that she could not hear me on a Wi-Fi call to avoid allowing me to speak with her supervisor, I was able to find a solution on my own on the internet. I asked to speak with her supervisor, she asks if I will hold for a few minutes. Five minutes later she comes back on the line and states: ""I'm sorry sir, all of our supervisors are currently on a call."" I take pride in my level headed demeanor and inform the lady that she is an absolute waste of space. I also thanked her for wasting hours of my life. Then I said have a wonderful evening ma'am, expecting to hang up. She asked me some question, I honestly can't remember what it was .It most definitely was not ""Is there anything else I can do to assist you this evening, sir?"" She spoke English comparatively to a 35 year old American having spent a month in Brazil, who came home and claimed to speak Spanish fluently. I think she was making a desperate attempt at repairing her botched customer service call, thinking perhaps that she could pull off some last minute miracle act to somehow redeem her competence as well as her ability to perform her job. I did not afford her the chance and hung up the phone to search for somewhere to write a review about this experience.

"I started using Quicken back in the day when it looked like nothing more than a glorified electronic spreadsheet with pretty buttons.
When Microsoft released MS Money I switched to it because it was more intuitive than Quicken.
Now that Microsoft has abandoned that piece of software I switched back to Quicken and I have to admit it took me a while to get used to it.
To add insult to injury, I have recently switched from the Windows to the Mac platform and, in spite of reading the 300+ negative reviews for this software in Amazon.com, I decided to give Quicken Essentials for Mac a try.
So far this is what I have experienced:

- The software installed quickly and without a hiccup in my new iMac.

- I reviewed and closely followed the instructions on how to convert my Windows data so that it would be recognized by the new software. This was done without any problems or delays.

- I did have to set up again each one of my twelve bank accounts online individually, something that took me all but 10 minutes. Afterward I was able to download all my data to keep my accounts current.

- I was happy to find some of the same features that were present in the Windows version, such as Budgeting, Investing, and Mortgage tracker.

- Finally, I like the software interface in the Mac, which looks just like any other Mac software with colorful icons placed intuitively where I need them the most.

All in all I recommend this software without any objections.

"This is just a short review about the pronunciation correction feature.  Many of the other comments left here refer to the audio companion as being an advantage.  Actually, it does NOT recognize tonal differences.  I have been studying Chinese for a year and have always been given great compliments about my tones in Chinese (my Chinese is NOT good yet, but I do well with the tones).  Just out of curiousity, I did the wrong tones on purpose and the voice recognition system still tells me that I am correct.  It WOULD be a great help for those struggling with the basic sound system of Chinese, but in the classes that I have taken, it seems like most students struggle more with the tones and this product pretends like they don't exist when it grades you.  I even asked a Taiwanese friend to test it out for me, and she agreed that it will still tell you that you are correct even if your tones are wrong.

Other than this, I am happy with the system so far.  I do not expect to become fluent with the system, but it seems like it does well for what it is.

"In general, I think SuSE has always produced a great product.  I've been using SuSE since version 6.4 and It's been my primary home operating system since version 8.0.  I do not use Windows at all.  I'm currently running SuSE Linux 8.2 and I'm very satisfied with it.  I was anxiously awaiting SuSE 9.1 and the new SuSE kernel in the inexpensive ""personal"" edition that I've always used to update my SuSE Linux O/S.
I soon discovered that Novell has changed things!!!  !!!YOU CAN NO LONGER UPDATE YOUR SuSE Linux OPERATING SYSTEM USING THE PERSONAL EDITION!!!!  I'm not sure if this changed in version 9.0 or within this version, but it was a shock to me.  I've always used the inexpensive personal edition and supplemented it with downloaded software from various sites online.  To all long-time SuSE Users considering buying this version, be aware that you will need to have the ""update"" or ""professional"" edition to update your current SuSE Linux system!
I'm very disappointed by this change, particularly since I spent about $30 on a version that I have no use for whatsoever.  The box should have been clearly labeled to indicate that this version CANNOT BE USED FOR UPDATING SYSTEMS and I would strongly recommend that Novell place this prominently on the box in the future!!!
For USERS NEW TO SuSE AND/OR Linux WHO WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY, I can recommend this edition however.  The ""Live CD"" makes trying SuSE painless and SuSE is still probably the best desktop Linux around for the price that's *relatively* easy to install, configure, and enjoy.  As for those users complaining that it doesn't work with or like Windows, I think they just wanted a cheap Windows knock-off, but Linux is something different and has to be approached as a separate thing with its own merits.  A new user will have to learn Linux just as they once had to learn Windows.  It's an adjustment, but it's not so bad if you can devote a little time and energy to learning it.

"Windows 2000 Advanced Server has been such an excellent platform, and I have no plans for its retirement from my network. It plays well in the Active Directory environment of my Windows 2003 Servers and also handles the execution of some of my legacy applications. As for other platforms, Linux (especially my favorite, SuSE) offers an environment that opens you up to the open source world (especially important if you are involved in research, as so many applications from the research community evolve from the open source arena). Open source is where the action and fun is!  Im looking forward to a pet project of integrating my SuSE Linux & Windows servers, perhaps along LDAP lines, later this year. Its all about opening up possibilities, not cat fighting, and Windows 2000 Advanced Server is cordially invited.

By the way, keep in mind that Windows 2000 does not support 48-bit LBA out of the box, nor does it after applying all the updates and service packs. 48-bit LBA must be enabled manually, at HKLM\system\currentcontrolset\services\atapi\parameters:

Add the following value: EnableBigLba.

This is mandatory for running with harddrives greater than 137GigaBytes. The consequences for not implementing this switch are data corruption and complete loss of your NT2000 partition.

I have 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate with 16GB RAM.
For this product, I installed the drivers and software from the CD, then downloaded and installed the Windows 10 patch from the vendor web site. Then I plugged it in. It was immediately recognized.
I connected the video and audio cables to my VCR and the Roxio device, and fired up the app. It worked, and I saw the blue screen from the VCR.

The Roxio software is not that great. When I tried to write a captured video to DVD, it appears to have written it out for the wrong region. I couldn't get that feature to work. I also had times when the app would hang.

"I had 2 years of high school German many years ago and now that I am retired I thought it might be fun to learn a new language to help keep my mind active.  I picked Spanish because I never really used the German I learned and with Spanish TV and trips to Yuma I figured I might be able to use it.  I did quite a bit of research to find a program I could really learn the language at home on my own schedule.  This is the best program I found.  The program teaches you how to understand, speak, read and write the language.  It is done all in Spanish through pictures.  You are shown a picture and you are expected to respond in Spanish.  The voice recognition decides if you are speaking it correctly and does not continue until you do.  It also asks you to type answers in Spanish to questions or pictures.  It builds from single words to sentences and to groups of sentences.  You can go back and redo lessons which I have many times but it also retests you at timed intervals based on the questions you missed.  I have been working with it for 5 months now and really enjoy it.

Some things you should think about before you buy this expensive program.  Learning a new language while fun is also very time consuming.  The person taking the course needs to be motivated to continue because this isn't a 2 week course but a learning system and will take you a year working every day to become fluent enough to actually use the language.

If you are really committed to learning a language I'd suggest you buy all 3 levels at once.  It is expensive but far cheaper that buying them one at a time.  I bought the first level to see if I would like it and then ended up having to buy the other 2 levels separately.  This gave me 3 sets of headphones.  There is also an audio companion that comes with each level.  I found it difficult to use and stopped after a couple of months.  I may go back and try it after I have completed the levels.

What else do you need besides the course?  Well, I would suggest a good Spanish/English dictionary.  Sometimes it is hard to tell exactly what is shown in the picture.  You can get Spanish children's books from the library and of course Spanish TV.  This will help you with the sound and rhythm of the language.  You can listen to popular Spanish songs.  You've heard the phrase ""Lost in translation."" well the words that flow so well in one language probably won't in another.  The rhymes of Dr Seuess work well in English and fall flat in Spanish and the lyrical Spanish songs sound clunky when translated.  But don't let this stop you.  The goal is to think in both languages.  Once past level one I would suggest the book ""Breaking out of Beginner's Spanish"" by  Joseph J. Keenan.  It is not a language book but a book on the customs of Spanish countries.  Using I when talking about yourself is common in English but considered self centered and arrogant in Spanish so it is dropped.

If you are considering Rosetta Stone for someone else or aren't really sure for yourself they offer a free lesson CD.  Try that first.

"I usually don't leave a review on the net.  Actually, this is my first time to leave a review on Amazon, even though I am a long-time Amazon member. However, I'd like to share a few thoughts about Pronunciation Pattern for those who are interested in an English accent program.

As an ESL instructor for many years, I've tried many different accent reduction programs (books, CDs, etc.) for my ESL students.  I've literally come across hundreds of them.  Many are terrible, some are ok, and a few are good, but this program is the BEST.  It really stands out.

Since other reviewers have already mentioned about the good features of this program, let me just make my review brief.

PROS:
* The online support is GREAT!  I've contacted customer service several times so far, and I always get a prompt response - sometime just in a few minutes!  I am really impressed with their online support.  So far I've been 100% satisfied.
* This program is VERY comprehensive. It deals with so many different aspects of English pronunciation. It also covers several thousand English words, NOT only a few hundred.  It's not like you study a few days and then there's nothing more left.  I know from personal experience there are many accent reduction programs (and books with CDs) out there with very little content.  This program offers not only the sounds of individual words and sentences but also clear phonological explanations.
* This program is good for advanced ESL students too.
* Like most non-natives, ESL students are familiar with the IPA, and this program lets you choose IPA to practice the sounds of English.
* What I really like about this program is they keep upgrading this program automatically.  I think that's another plus for this program

CONS:
* The high price might be a problem for some ESL students.  But l still believe this program is best on the market.
* Since this is a computer-based program, some people might think this program is complicated to use.
* Not really a ""con,"" but there are a lot of features in this program to learn.  If you are looking for a simple English accent course, this program is probably NOT for you.

BOTTOM LINE:
If you are an ESL student (or instructor) looking for a program that reduce your foreign accent, look no further. I say it again: This program is the BEST",excellent program!,False,1273622400,1.0986122886681098,1.0

"This program includes 1,500 Thai words, written in both Thai and transliterated English. The program includes audio, so you can hear how each word is pronounced. The words are divided into categories like ""airport,"" ""changing money,"" ""clothes,"" etc. You can study the words either within those categories, or by adding them to your ""wordbank"" and then studying your wordbank.
If you want to study the words in your wordbank in the form of flashcards, each word in the wordbank will be presented to you in written Thai. When you click on flashcard, the English translation is given, and you have the option of hearing the Thai pronunciation.

There are two aspects of this program that I didn't like. First, the vocabulary selection is terrible. Too much of it is tourist specific. Even if you were using the course to prepare for a trip to Bangkok, you don't need to know the Thai words for ""duty free,"" ""hangar"" and ""boarding gate"" to travel around the country. And that type of vocabulary is worthless for a beginning or intermediate student. What percentage of your daily conversations involve airplane hangars or duty free shops? In short, there aren't enough useful verbs in this program. Second, the flashcards always appear in the same order. So, for example,  if you're studying colors, you will know after you've been through the cards a couple times that green comes after blue, even if you don't actually recognize the Thai word for green.

But, having aired my complaints, I wish I had had a program like this 20 years ago when I was studying Russian, or 25 years ago when I was studying French. Studying Thai vocabulary without audio is almost pointless. So this program provides an inexpensive way to practice reading and pronouncing Thai while building your vocabulary.",An easy way to build your Thai vocabulary,True,1379721600,0.0,1.0

I went from PSP8 to X7 because of the memory issues, and the interface has changed yet again. Not only that, but I get these annoying ads all the time.

Further, changing the properties on vector shapes is a hit or miss proposition. The properties menu item in the layer pane does NOT allow you to change the border or background color of the shape. Instead, you have to futz around on the canvas and hope you right-click in the right place to be able to select properties in the displayed context menu.

Finally, I've somehow managed to get the app into some weird-aZZ mode that will not allow me to do anything to a vector shape once it's drawn. I'm going to have to UNINSTALL the app and reinstall to get it back to where it should be.

When QE first came out I purchased it immediately. I quickly found that it wasn't going to work out for me but Intuit said it was a work in process. I figured I'm OK with that and kept it while still using Quicken 2007. Every once in a while I'd check with them and updates to see if it had improved. Never to a point where I could migrate to it. Finally we come to the present where Apple is about to release OS X Lion which will no longer have support for older programs (like Quicken 2007). Intuit still has no plans to include features from the previous version in Essentials nor does it plan on support 2007 with Lion.

In preparation of the release of Lion I've been checking out other applications (iBank, Moneydance). I think I'll be going with Moneydance as it appears it can do everything I am used to in Quicken 2007.

My thoughts regarding Intuit and the Mac OS. They've never had a product that is as robust as their Windows product. Even Quicken 2007 lacks a lot of functionality of the Window counterpart. Quicken Essentials has dropped a bunch more functionality. It appears that Intuit half-heartedly supports its product on MacOS X. Even if you find that QE may do what you need it to I'd still be hesitant. You never know when Intuit will choose not to support that product any longer. I'd definitely recommend looking at the competition. I was able to get Moneydance to work properly with online banking, my loans/mortgage.

I have used Vegas Video for a long time and it is always a winner. I will always give Vegas 5 Stars.

The program HitFilm 2 Express ,which is a seperate program. ( It is the one in this package NOT Ultimate.)
Of course the Ultimate is the one with all the bells and whistle. (Ultimate is an upgrade)

My first impression of Hitfilm Express 2 was, whats the big deal.
But the more I worked with it the better it got.
You can do some really good effects with this program. For example you can make a missle with smoke trailing behind.
Pretty cool. There are lots of other effects you can do.

HitFilm Express 2 gets 5 stars from me and thats because I know when I upgrade to Ultimate I will love it.

The BEST REVIEW for these programs is YouTube.
There are some really great tutorials for both. Most of what I have seen for Hitfilm was the Ultimate version but some stuff you can use with Express and Utimate.

They both have really, really good forums, so you can always get help when you have problems.

The video you are working on in Vegas can be put in HitFilm to do some more editing and add effects, then if you want you can put it back in Vegas and do more editing.

Both programs work really good together. I haven't had any problems with them working together, no lock ups.

The program runs pretty much the same as the Mac version, but is a little more clunky. The ""inspector"" does not have as many functions available to you at such easy access. Most of these functions are still in the program but you have to go and find them somewhere else or use hotkeys (for example, the footnotes/annotations feature cannot be found in the inspector in this version).

Likes:
It is Scrivener! Great program, nice to have on a PC

Dislikes:
Some features not as easy to access as in Mac

Bottom line:
Scrivener is an amazing program and my complaints only really apply to people who have used the Mac version. If you have not, then you won't know what I am complaining about and no need to worry.",Great! Not as smooth as Mac,True,1346198400,3.58351893845611,1.0

"First off, if you are looking for software to help you with turn-by-turn directions, I recommend Google Maps or Google Earth, both of which are free.  If you're looking for something a little more robust,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Microsoft-Streets-Trips-2009/dp/B001EHXOFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Microsoft Streets & Trips 2009</a>&nbsp;might do the trick.  But if you're going to use your software for personal use as opposed to business, you aren't going get a good value out of MapPoint.

That said, for anyone looking for business use, look no further because you won't find a more full-featured software package at this price point.

There are a ton of features and you can try them all by downloading a 60 day trial from Microsoft, but the most important for me are the route optimization and territories & demographic data.  Put simply, route optimization takes a series of stops and maps out the most efficient way to traverse them.  If you do any kind of deliveries, this software will pay for itself by way of saved time and gas.  If you're focused on sales or marketing, the demographic overlays and ability to create territories is easily the best part of this software.

The program isn't perfect, though.  I felt the interface could have been a little more user-friendly.  For example, Google Maps spoiled me for address entry and I would have hoped Microsoft would have caught on.  With Google you can type just about anything- you don't have to worry too much about formatting and can even leave off the city and state because it remembers where your home location is.  This was not so with MapPoint, which was pretty stiff by comparison.

Lastly, I wanted to cover a couple of points mentioned in other reviews.  Some reviewers have pointed out the ""coupons"" feature, which is supposed to look up coupons for businesses along your route or near your destination.  I personally didn't find this very useful.  Many times it either found nothing or a simple Google search found more options.  Also, a few reviewers have talked about the lack of push pins, but I would like to mention that it is VERY easy to add your own icons to personalize the software.

So all-in-all I give MapPoint 4 out of 5 stars.  It's a great piece of software and very reasonably priced for business needs.  It lost a star, though, for not keeping up with some of the user-friendliness of software that's available for free.","For business, not pleasure",False,1250380800,0.0,1.0

As others have noted, the program slows your PC down to a crawl creating very frustrating days. You wait and wait and wait. But there are also many other things that contribute to more frustration.

There are so many bugs in the software that you frequently are forced to re-install and regenerate ""remote databases.""

"I don't know what is up with these bozos.  You'd think that after years of customer angry complaints that they would try to do something about the problems.  What is wrong now, I hear you ask?  Let me count the ways it continues to suck.

1) Installation problems.  At best it takes an age to install.  At worst, one gets an error that it can't update.  If you search for the error codes, they know exactly what the problem is and they give steps to fix it ... so why don't they fix it before the user hits the wall?

2) They do try, but still fail at being clear about what you are working on at any moment.  Yes, this is mostly caused by our convoluted tax code, but if an accountant knows what he is working on, Turbo Tax should as well, and make it clear.

3) It simply fails to WORK at times.  I entered data into boxes on a 1099 and it came back and told me I left a box blank ... and SHOWED me the filled in box.  What is up with that?

4) UPDATE:  I am entirely wrong in this.  TurboTax is right, though it could have used a few words to clarify so I'd avoid the confusion.

*** I suspect (but have not completely checked) that there are some glaring errors in the product.  For example: I believe that someone cannot contribute to an IRA if they are covered by an employee pension plan.  (There are probably lots of conditions there so I'm not sure.)  In any case, my wife is covered, she is having her salary reduced by contributions, and yet TT prompts to contribute to an IRA before 04/18, promising that I can reduce taxes by $800+ if I do so.  If this is wrong, I'll be subject to an excess contribution penalty.  So, because of AT LEAST a lack of clarity, I'm going to have to spend some time in research on my own.  Call me silly, but that is what I paid TT to do for me! ***

5) The dreaded ""updating partner info"" hang.  TT is fantastic in that it will go directly to your financial institutions (in some cases) and download the forms directly from them.  Saves a few minutes typing in numbers.  Problem is, EACH TIME you elect that option, it hangs for three to five minutes with that message.  It really is faster simply to type it in yourself.

"Here are the basics:

* Captures video and photos from your hard drives, video input (camcorder, vcr, dvd, digital cam, etc.), tv tuner cards, all the normal stuff here. One highlight is that the software will accept both NTSC and PAL format input without issues - so feel free to share those videos with friends around the world.
* Has a full suite of special effects that you can add to your presentation, and when I say full suite, I mean a LOT. Hundreds of transitions, overlays, titles, and effects.
* Output options are vast - it's not just about writing it to a flat video file, you can send it back to a camcorder tape, mobile devices, youtube*, DVD and HD DVD, and more. It comes with all the expected menuing options as well (to create menu's on your DVD splash screen).

Here's what I like:
* File support can't be beat. No more limits to mpg, avi, wmv like you get in things like Windows Movie Maker*, this program pretty much reads everything including Quicktime* and Flash*, and as I mentioned before, PAL format too. This was a big win for me recently because I was putting together a video presentation that included video from the US and from India. Ulead was the ONLY program I had that would read the files without having to convert them first.
* Effects are vast. If you are used to some of the cool transitions you get in Windows Movie Maker* you're familiar with things like flips, rolls, slides, shatters, etc. Ulead steps it up a notch with 3D flips and spins, colour masks, clock style transitions, texture effects, peels, pushes, rolls, slides, stretches, wipes, and more. It even comes with a set of pre-installed flash animations that plug right into your movie or overlay on an existing slide.
* Audio options are significantly enhanced. Not only can you put it into waveform view, but you can dynamically change the volume and direction of the audio. These features are like Audacity* or Cakewalk* - you can drag and drop volume changes and even shift audio to left and right channels. This was pretty incredible to me and not something I've seen in any other movie maker software. Voice track is also available but not something I have used since I use pre-packaged audio for my movies.
* Setting exact time for a slide. In other programs it's difficult to set a slide to display for an exact time down to the split second. Ulead makes this easy with a detail page for each slide that you can configure timeline and other functions. I use this all the time. This detail page also offers dynamic pan/zoom and resizing of the image you're using, and if it's an image, instant colour correction. Very powerful. If it's a video you can reverse it, change the speed, split the audio, and dynamically trim the clip.

What bothers me:
* Limited TITLE templates out the box. The templates they provide seem pretty hokey, but you can do some level of customization and then save your new template (I just wanted more out of the box) - the other issue here is that you have to create a blank colour box (with associated duration) and overlay the title on it. This is very different from other tools that will automatically create a title slide for you. Titles are very important to me, as well as credits, which this tool doesn't have out of the box.
* Adding transitions and effects is clunky and time consuming. Drag and drop takes a while because of the distance between the transition and the timeline. Additionally, you can not highlight multiple sequences and apply a transition to each one en masse. In other words, if you want the same transition between 10 slides, you have to do it 10 times.

Overall Rating: 4 of 5, with 1 point removed for minor usability issues and insufficient title templates out of the box.

Summary: One of the most powerful video editing and movie creation tools I have used. Easily beats competitors like Roxio* and Windows Movie Maker*, although, for free movie creation, WMM* does provide a lot of functionality. For professional movie creation and the flexibility this program offers in input and output options, I'm very impressed.

"My wife will be the primary user of this program.  She has limited but nicely improving computer skills and has found many graphics programs to be wholly unsatisfactory.  At first, she didn't like this either.  But with more use, she found it to be fairly easy to use and she was able to get better results than previous programs.  Her primary use is for scrap booking projects.

Having gotten fairly proficient with Photoshop Elements 8 (and improving on 9), she doesn't use this for significant manipulation of photographs.  But for someone who still finds PSE (let along full Photoshop) intimidating, this is a reasonable place to start.

With reference to the tutorials, she moved from not liking the program at all, to one she started to learn on, and expects to use in the future.  There are some easier programs, and there are more complex ones.  This seems to be about in the middle in terms of complexity, and documentation doesn't help things a lot.

On Turbotax, you have to purchase a separate personal and business editions if you have anything more than a sole proprietorship.  Given that I have two LLC's I made the switch to save money.  How hard could it be since H & R Block is a huge tax company.

"Message in a Haunted Mansion is the third Nancy Drew game, and far superior compared to the first two. This game sets the standard to what the majority of Nancy Drew games contain, and is the first to use the formal ""Nancy Drew case formula"". It is this game that employs several aspects that become rules for future cases, such as ""there must always be four suspects"" and ""there must always be a long-lost treasure"".

Rose Green, a friend of Hannah Gruen's (Nancy's housekeeper), has recently purchased a Victorian mansion in San Francisco, California. She and her friend and co-owner, Abby Sideris, hope to turn the place into a bed-and-breakfast by the following month. However, several peculiar accidents have been getting in the way of the renovations. Hannah asks that Nancy go over to help complete the renovation, while secretly performing an investigation to find out just what's causing the accidents. Nancy soon finds herself in an old mansion that's filled with a dark past, unexplainable shadows, ghostly voices, and unexpected accidents that could happen at any moment. Is an inhabitant of this manor trying to scare everybody away, or are the restless spirits of the previous owners truly back to haunt the place?

The plot used in this game is phenomenal, and a great idea for Nancy's first ""haunted house"" mystery. Even though the criminal in this game isn't a killer, it still holds on to the scare factor that the first two held, and the danger does become life-threatening at times. The game itself does get pretty scary, and all of the references to the history of California and China that were employed in the plot were very well-integrated.

I will come out and say this about the plot: the ending does become very predictable if one pays attention closely. The location of the ending, the history of the Valdez family (the family who originally owned the manor), the culprit, and his/her intentions all become rather obvious. This is a slight downside, but regardless, all of these aspects of the plot were perfectly executed.

Even though this is only the third game, the quality of this game rivals (and usually even goes beyond) most of the modern games. There are still chores that need to be done and puzzles to solve, but Nancy doesn't spend more time doing chores than investigating or performing puzzle after puzzle after puzzle like she does in several of the more recent games. This game has the perfect blend of sleuthing, puzzle-solving, and chores.

The graphics in this game might show the age on occasion, but they're still rather nice, and almost as good as graphics in a modern game would be. The manor is beautifully detailed, and all of the ghostly haunts that are seen with the eye are wonderfully animated. The character designs are a little more smooth and realistic than the ones in the previous game, now looking like a cross between Barbie dolls and actual human anatomy.

The characters were casted wonderfully, and they were all well-integrated into the story. Rose Green, the owner, is the frustrated woman who spent her entire life savings into the house. She's very determined to stick with the place, but is starting to get discouraged. Abby Sideris is her eccentric business partner, who believes in ghosts and all sorts of supernatural phenomenon. At one point in the game, she even hosts a sance to contact the spirit haunting the house. Charlie Murphy is a young man who's currently employed to help with the renovations. He seems young and inexperienced, but is actually very knowledgeable and is studying history at the local community college. Louis Chandler is an antique dealer about Rose's age, and he's helping the others find some good authentic dcor to keep the traditional Victorian feel while renovating the manor into a B&B.

One wonderful aspect about the cast in Message in a Haunted Mansion that definitely deserves mention is the perfect choice for the culprit. It's not quite like the previous game, Stay Tuned for Danger, in which Mattie, Rick, Dwayne, Lillian, Bill, and Millie all have solid motives to send the threats to Rick and could very well be the culprit at the end. There's only one character in this game that would seem to profit well from performing these acts of vandalism around the house, and I cannot see any of the other suspects being the culprit in the end.

The music in the game was perfect. It made an already very frightening house seem even more haunted. There wasn't a single track that felt out of place, and they ranged from slightly eerie to downright terrifying. The Chinese music heard in Nancy's bedroom complimented the dcor as well, as her room is full of old Chinese furnishings.

Message in a Haunted Mansion has brought the Nancy Drew games from sub-par, old school fun to true accomplishments in the history of adventure gaming. From this point forward, the Nancy Drew games have a tendency to be amazing. Despite the age, this beautiful game full of ghostly frights remains in my top ten favorite Nancy Drew games of all time.",The Message: This Game Rocks!,False,1306368000,1.0986122886681098,1.0

While the protection is very powerful, it could feel clunky at times when it warns you something minor needs to be adjusted.  The File Vault feature is a great addition to this suite.

"I have only used an earlier version of MapPoint and even then for only in a strictly direction-finding capacity. I understood the data mapping functionality of the product but that was never a feature I intended to use. MapPoint 2009 seems to go one better than that earlier version in refining both those features I like and use (ie. direction and route finding) and those which I have less use of.

From a usability standpoint, this interface is intuitive and easy-to-use. For me, there were no problems with moving around the map interface and zooming in to whatever I was interested with either the mouse or keyboard. The various features for route planning is as good as any other on the market today and as this is my primary focus, I'm functionally happy with MapPoint 2009. With the ""optimize trip"", MapPoint 2009 helps me make the best use of my time, especially when I am geocaching when I have to hit caches in several different areas. In that regard, I find it handles off-road situations rather poorly, but that's understandable. With features like being able to create what they call a ""Drivetime Zone"", you can find subtle and cool ways to use your maps. Drivetime Zones will select and show you what you can reach within a set amount of time from a particular center point.

"Until recently, I had been a longtime user of what was once Paint Shop Pro, now renamed PaintShop Photo Pro X3. I was hoping Corel had fixed the bugs in Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 when it released this new version. But it didn't.

Instead, the company seems to have added a feature here and there for marketing purposes and stayed with the same set of problems with the same set of problems from X2.

Corel is the only company I have dealt with to offer that as a standard solution to a problem with their software.

Other drawbacks are the backup runs constantly, backing up on the fly.  This is annoying because some files, which are not in use, are being backed up constantly.

"After 3-frustrating hours I finally installed the 2014 Enhanced Payroll. My 2013 subscription was set to expire on the 24th, so I started the renewal process 4-days early - just in case. By then, my 2013 subscription had mysteriously already expired.
Try to call Intuit on any of their published support phone lines and you will be directed to their patronizing website payroll.com/helpme. You're out of luck if you do not have an internet connection. After navigating layer-after-layer, I was unable to find a solution to my simple request to renew an expired subscription, so I had to choose a logical department.

The Intuit rep that answered my call did not understand my request or English. He asked me to download an app to allow him to control my computer and then told me I had to upgrade when he could not validate my account that I have had for more than 10-years. I was forced to hang up or lose my sanity and try the only other function, the ""Call Me Back"" service. That failed after 12 minutes on hold - and this is after they called me! Intuit called again later and this rep understood my request but obviously had no experience with customer service etiquette in the US.

This is how to install your update for an expired subscription: If you purchased this boxed subscription, the cd will instruct you to use the ""Update from Box"" option. This option does not appear on the QB Premier 2013 - that is until you delete your expired key (EMPLOYEES -> MY PAYROLL SERVICE -> MANAGE SERVICE KEYS). Only then will the wizard advance to the registration page where you are greeted with this friendly mandatory notice:

I understand that I am enrolling in an auto renewal program, and by entering my account information and clicking Continue, I authorize Intuit, via electronic signature, to charge my credit card account the year's subscription price then in effect each year until I cancel.

Hey Intuit, newsflash I DO NOT AGREE! That is why I always purchase my discounted subscriptions from Amazon. Unfortunately, QuickBooks is a necessary evil. They price the cost of their automatic updates to make them cost prohibitive and the process of implementing a third party purchase nearly impossible. I have a year to consider options and it will not be Intuit. Steer clear if you can.

"MapPoint's biggest selling point is how easy it can be integrated with Excel or Access to crossreference demographic and business statistics.  If nothing else, you can easily use it as an encyclopedia of US demographic traits by state, county, ZIP code or census tract, conveniently downloadable into an Excel spreadsheet.  If your work entails collecting and analyzing raw data with Excel, MapPoint can be a very powerful tool.  However, MapPoint's use is limited in creating visually appealing, customizable maps (ostensibly its primary purpose).
The inability to fully customize a map's presentation, and particularly the colors, is a real drawback.  The program features a limited number of color schemes for presenting data.  There is no way to remove county names and other labels even from the less-cluttered ""Data Map"" option so as to create a ""data-only"" map.

"I've used several photo and video editing programs, and these are my favorites. Easier to learn than PhotoShop, but more robust than most of the simpler photo programs-- and the video editing has a huge range of features and is stable. Here's a little more on each:

PHOTO

I've had versions 2 and 3, so this was an upgrade from 3 for me. If you're upgrading, you'll notice that the interface looks different. I wondered whether the upgrade was going to be worth it-- drives me crazy when software companies come out with new versions every year and you have to pay for upgrades. But Corel doesn't disappoint.

There are now three workspaces: ""manage"" to upload and organize your photos, ""adjust"" for quick editing, and ""edit"" for more in-depth editing. On-screen tutorials teach you what's what.

I was particularly impressed with the improvement to the advanced red eye feature-- you ever get a photo where the flash doesn't just turn someone's eye red, but like a giant blue circle (like you see in pet photos)? I had a great picture of my daughter and her cousin, but one of my daughter's eyes was all bizarre like that and I had little hope of making it look normal. Then I used the advanced red eye feature here, and it actually ""rebuilds"" the eye. It draws in a pupil and everything, asking you what color to make the eye. And the darn thing looked natural!

If you had preferences saved in an older version, you'll have to redo them here-- for example, whether or not you want to save all original photos when you're editing them.

There are some cool new effects, like kaleidoscope and sandstone.

Other new features: You can now upload to Facebook and Flicker and send photos by email directly from the program. At least theoretically-- I haven't yet had any success getting my e-mail configured with the program, but that's not a big deal for me.

You can also print multiple photos on a single page more easily now.

VIDEO

Many reviewers have mentioned this software as being ""intuitive"" and that they didn't have to crack the manual. I can only assume that those reviewers weren't trying to do very complicated things with the software-- which is totally fine. There's a great market for people who want nothing more than to create little personal videos for family or online use. However, for those of us who want to ""take it to the next level"" without months or years of studying, you can definitely do that with this software.

Until now, most of my home movies were made using One True Media-- a super online service for beginners that makes it very easy to make short videos combining photos and digital video clips with music and effects to share online or burn to DVD. However, I had pushed that service to its max-- it gets very, VERY slow and tedious when you try to make long videos (mine were mostly around 30-45-minutes). The download times were appalling and there were certainly limitations to how much you could customize. So I was ready to try a more advanced program, and this one fit the bill.

I didn't find it quite as intuitive as others did. Some of the basic functions were simple to figure out, but if you want to explore the nitty-gritty bits that make this program what it is and set it apart from earlier versions, then you're probably going to need the manual and the online tutorials, and maybe some good ole' search engine help. For instance, I had problems figuring out how to get Mercalli to work to stabilize parts of my videos. When I tried to apply it to my clips, an error message would continually tell me to try again. Some poking around online finally led me to a video where a user showed the simple step I was missing that enabled Mercalli to work-- which was nowhere in Corel's manual. I loved Mercalli-- I was walking around during a parade while filming, and using this program, it looks so much smoother. Very little trial and error is necessary to figure out the right settings for particular types of clips.

I also wanted to figure out how to customize my audio tracks to fade in and out at particular intervals-- to be quiet during video clips and louder during still photos, for instance-- and couldn't figure that out entirely from the manual, either. It was a video from a VideoStudio Pro X2tutorial that walked me through the steps (even though the interface looked different, it was close enough that I could figure it out).

The newly-added Boris Graffiti is nice, too, to create titles and graphics that are more interesting than you'll find in simpler video programs. This will really allow you to get graphically creative if that's up your alley.

The program has crashed on me once in about 20 hours of heavy use (during audio uploading), but it saved my project, so it wasn't a big deal. However, I have a machine well above the specs required, so I was a bit disappointed that it crashed at all. It loads and uploads video, audio, and photos in a reasonable amount of time.

There are vast numbers of tutorials on YouTube that show how to really get the most out of the program using features like stop-motion animation, image correction, and advanced video editing techniques, so it really depends on how much time and effort you want to expend to get the best result. You can be satisfied with just studying the program for an hour or so and making a nice little video, or you can spend a month or two learning all the ins and outs and making really impressive videos that you can use to promote your business, preserve family memories, and so on.

I think it's a very fair price for all the bundle includes. You can't go wrong with these two programs if you're ready to play with some great photo and video editing tools.",Great Bundle,False,1334620800,0.0,1.0

"One star might be overkill, but Intuit explicitly asked for me to write a review right at the moment when I was feeling particularly frustrated with their product.
I've used Quicken for many years, and it's been some time since there's been any new feature I've cared about.  I try to use the existing version as long as possible until they threaten to kill my ability to download transactions from my banks.  I would have happily paid them to get support extended, but instead, they forced me to install the new product which has a worse interface and new bugs.  Why can't they show consistent $$$ amounts on accounts on all screens?  The discrepancy is minor, but disturbing.  Also, their new portfolio of investment assets is a major leap backwards - no longer possible for me to view positions and then enter a transaction on the same screen - they force me back to a previous screen, which wastes time and makes detailed reconciliation difficult.
Other interface changes are neutral, just irritating that I have to learn new places to find things.
It bewilders me why they have to keep all these programmers on staff just to make the product worse over time.
---
Update: The Bugs continue to mount.  Today I tried to reconcile transactions.  It warned me that the two transactions I was trying to reconcile had different amounts.  Not true, they were exactly identical.  It refused to let me say they were the same, so I eventually had to leave the reconciliation screen and delete one of them.
---
Update:
The bug list grows and grows.  Investment lot positions are calculated incorrectly due to commission costs under Account view.  It shows correctly when I look at the original transaction.  I wasted 25 minutes trying to figure out why it was not reconciling to my account statement.
---
Update:
Gotta hand it to them - it takes real effort to make so many bad decisions in the interface.  It used to be that you would ""accept"" a downloaded transaction from either of two buttons.  Now one says ""Accept"" and the other says ""Save"".  As far as I can tell, they do the same thing.  Why the different labels?

"I was hoping I could import (and at the minimum export) GIS shapefile in this program, which is a map format used by many other mapping softwares. There is so much free data in the public domain in shapefile format, but you can not use it in this program. Nor can you export anything you create in this program to other mapping softwares like ESRI ArcMap or AutoCAD. The subject isn't even cover in help or on Microsofts web site.

I was excited to see a ""coupon"" feature where you can look for special offers geographically, but was very disappointed that you have to pay extra to use that feature. In addition, like other reviewers have noted, if you want to use the GPS feature, you have to purchase it separately.

Road mapping coverage is limited to the USA and Mexico. The rest of the world is shown, but only by country boundaries and name.

I like the ""Data Mapping Wizard"" that lets you visual all sort of demographic data (age, education, ethnicity, income, occupation) along with much more like earth quakes and weather.

I also liked the cartography of the maps. They are very visually appealing and easy to read. There are lots of ""push pin"" symbols to choose from and the printed maps look very professional as well.

Overall, I think the package is somewhat overpriced at $300, but considering at full-feature GIS software from ESRI costs $1,500 to over $10,000; it's a good way to get started.

"It was two years ago, that I bought a HP HDX9010NR 20.1 inch portable computer at CompUSA. They recommeded the AVG software, so I bought my first security software. It was v7.5 and with the CD included, I was able to install it in short order. My old CPQ computer, would at times, require a full backup, as I got various virus(s) and this would take about (8) hours to download everything again. I soon learned, a faster way (<20 minutes), to recover on the CPQ. After the CompUSA recommendation, I loaded the AVG 7.5 on my new computer. I use a dialup=[...], at around $8.00/month, as most of my work does not need to be fast, and so I can save a little money, since my retirement eight years ago. But... my data that I download off the internet, does need to be done everyday for sure, except on the weekends. I always buy at least two identical computers, sometimes even, five of the same model. In fact, we have five old HP's from the early to mid 1980's, that we still run every Friday nite, with our own programs for (4-6) hours. The secret to long lasting computers, is to have UPS's installed, and to always inplug them, when not using them in case of an electrical surge brownouts, or even lighting. We use a Christmas tree remote controls, to assure, the main electrcal lines are indeed off, plus all the UPS's switches, and even the computer switches are off too, when they are not in operation. So 1980 to 2009=29 years and still the original five computers, are in perfect running shape, as in ""brand new"". These old computers are not on the internet, however, and are not ""windows"" and so have no security problems or attacks.

Recently AVG wanted me to upgrade, for free, to v8.5 as my two years, on 7.5 had not yet expired. I tried twice, and with dialup and Vista Ultimate, I failed every time, at around the two hour download mark. As my contract, was soon over, I decided to buy the AVG v8.5 on a CD, so I could download quickly. The best price, I could find was {{AMAZON.COM}}, and so my 3 computers version and 8.5 was quickly shipped by Amazon. AVG about that time notified me, that my two year contract, was about to expired, yet Amazon thru USPS deliverd the v8.5 just in time (JIT). Later AVG gave me an extra month, to buy from them, before cutting me off, but I was up and running by then. Having the CD makes the download much faster, and I more than likely, could not download the new AVG, due to my dialup's slow speed with Vista/Netscape.

Many times the old 7.5 would yield a popup window saying, my E-Mail virus protection and my firewall were not installed. Now, with the v8.5, I am fully protected in all items listed, in the AVG main window. One word of caution, is in the update and searching through your computer files, can take up to two hours when scanning your whole computer. I had it set, to do that at 22:00 each night, and that is way too much and too often. I have since cut that back, to only once per month. I try to go to lunch, at a restaurant, and come back in say two hours, and she will be done scanning. Your computer can get extremely slow, if that task is done in the background, while you are surfing the net.

All and all, AVG appears to me to be an excellent product, and I would give it a full five stars for their technology and constant updates of their latest protection improvements. After reading, all the other folks discussions, about other security products/systems coupled with others own AVG ratings, I am sure that I have the best system available. My two new HP 9010's computers have, dual hard disks, and also have a unique recovery {Restore points}. I have used several these times. but that is part of the Vista Ultimate system/HP system, which is fine too. I also bought from Amazon.com the books on Vista, Office 2007 and Excel to serve as backup references for us.

One unique problem, that I did have, is that on rare occasions the computer would lockup completely. In fact, the first weekend she locked with the familar spinning circle forever. I did everything, to unlock the computer, and even drove across town to Books a Million to find the answer in a reference book to unlock. No book had the answer. I finally used my brain power, and even pulling the power cord she kept spinning. I said you {idiot}, you must kill that darn computer, yet the battery is still powering it on. I disconnected all the extras; like printer, dual coolers, modem, and my three floppy Sony drives, and turned the computer upside down, on my couch. I released the battery, and it fell out, and it quit spinning circles. I had killed my computer!! Later, I found that if I had pressed, the on-off button for five seconds long, the darn computer would have re-started itself. When I graduated in 1960, from one of the finest engineering colleges (Ch. E.) in the USA, we did not have a computer, and now I have (15) computers myself. I even own Viscalc Software 1980 version, that was the pre-Excel software, that Bill Gates bought to build his Excel product line and empire of MSFT.  In the end, software, is more valuable, and worth the money, if it does the job; if it doesn't it is worth absolutely nothing. Believe me, AVG appears to be worth the price, at Amazon.com.

I have never been disappointed with the items I have bought at Amazon.com nor at Northern [...]. Almost all my computers and printers are HP's. Why not the best? You will not be disappointed.

I hope this rather lengthly discussion has been an aid to you.

the DVD again just installs the already installed program...

again (but of course, doesn't actually start the math program).

result of someone buying a bunch of different programs from

different companies at some open market in a foreign land where

"I have used this software for 10 months now, & I've found it very useful, but oh, so frustratingly s-l-o-w.  It is easy to use, once it finally comes up (took 20 minutes last night), so that even my 6 yr. old DGGD makes her cards all by herself.  We've sent a lot of cards to overseas troops, so even though there are some patriotic cards, I'd sure like Hallmark to have more selection suitable for deployed troops.

I don't normally buy cards because they are so expensive, but it is nice to be able to send personalized cards, so I do use it more than I expected.  Although there are a lot of designs, because there are so many categories & unusable ones, that I would really like to be able to download new designs.  One thing that has been particularly useful are the labels & tags.  I make all the tags for The Shoebox Project <[...]> & that is helpful.  For the past decade or more, I've printed all my Christmas & birthday tags (I could only handwrite ""TO:  Jeremy From:  Grandma & Grandpa"" so many times), but with this program I can easily use clip art & color for tags that are a lot more fun.  I use different holiday clip art for each gift recipient so I can easily find the correct tag in the drawer where I keep them (e.g., elder DD gets a cute Santa face, while I-for-Idiot SIL gets a sprig of holly because I couldn't find a holiday dunce cap).

I really dislike that I have to fire up a PC laptop to use this program.  I find myself balancing the laptop on top of my trusty Mac keyboard so I can use the same cord for the printer.  I also dislike that within categories, there is a sameness to the clip art.  Many designs are clearly done by the same artist & are too much alike.

I've tried several times to contact Hallmark to see whether I have to buy an entire new program for 2009 instead of an upgrade.  Could never reach a human.

"(Note: I am using SG on a Mac.)
Sitegrinder is indeed a revolutionary concept, and it seems so appealing for those of us who don't know CSS... HOWEVER, it is IN NO WAY as simple and carefree as they make it out to be. I have to struggle to get the sites to work, and even when they finally do, updating sites with client requests is becoming an absolute nightmare. For some mysterious reason, I find nothing but glowing reviews online. The endless deluge of problems listed in the SG Forums indicates that I'm not the only one having these issues.

GOOD:
- Very simple to learn, easy steps
- Very good support and documentation. Helpful Forum.

BAD:
- Random errors happen almost every time you use it
- Using in conjunction with Dreamweaver produces unexpected results, plus you have to re-grind from SG each time you make a design change, therefore you must re-do any work you did in DW. (Unless you know CSS, which defeats the whole purpose of this plugin.)
- It takes a long time to ""grind"" each time you have to do it.
- SG claims that its output is made to fit all browsers. It isn't. You still have to manually test your site on different browsers and different platforms to fix the little problems that pop up. Even the SG official site doesn't display properly on some browsers! That's saying something!
- simple updates are a insanely horrifying nightmare to get right
- Many times is unbelievably frustrating!

If I had to do it over again, I'd probably save my $ and actually learn CSS. I would NOT recommend basing your web design business on SG.

Using this software is tantamount to cutting off the head to cure the cold.

"TurboTax has been good to me for over a decade, but it's increasingly frustrating to use with slightly more complex tax situations. This year, TurboTax couldn't deal with college savings plan distributions. Data I entered from form 1098-T did not carry over, and TurboTax insisted that I owed taxes for excess withdrawals. I spent over an hour with a friendly support tech, who agreed there was a problem, but could not resolve it. She bumped it to a supervisor who (immediately) said it was an error that would be fixed shortly. 6 wks later, error is not fixed.

I finally threw in the towel and went to an accountant. He saved me far more than he cost, and didn't waste hours of my time.

"I've been using TurboTax for over ten years and have tried both the web version and disc product. I prefer the disc product since new versions will read the information from prior editions and automatically import them after installation. The 2011 edition was the fastest install ever. Even the updates did not take that long. I had a state download for CA that was also quick and streamlined. I was able to have my W-2 information imported (a real time saver, love that option) and the step by step screens were easier than ever to walk through. Printing and saving was also quite fast along with the federal e-file. It took barely a day to be submitted and accepted (this was in late Feb). State e-file was offered for an additional $19.95 which I didn't bother with. Unfortunately I don't get refunds. TurboTax is a solid product. I think the disc version is better than the online since the installation will read the previous version information and saves you a lot of time, especially if you continue to use the product as long as I have. I would not consider another tax product. It is so easy to revisit options or jump around to different sections.

I tried iBank via their 30 day trial earlier this year. Even with that it did not properly import the limited Quicken data I was able to import from my TWENTY-THREE (23) years of data from Quicken 2007 for Mac.
I thought perhaps iBank would address this VERY BASIC aspect in the latest upgrade since they are obviously trying to compete for previous Mac Quicken users ...... but no, not even in the latest and ""greatest""?

Another reviewer succinctly listed some of the other more basic features, common to Quicken, but STILL not present in iBank. I repeated those following ......

Things I hope they change:

1. The need to click OK whenever you want to edit a transaction.
2. Allow + and - or a pop-up box to change/enter dates
3. Have a blank transaction ready at all times rather than having to click + to add a new transaction
4. Allow tabbing through fields and allow enter to save transaction rather than clicking save. In general, anything to reduce the number of unnecessary clicks.

"For those of you considering buying Money 2002, I'd suggest going to the Microsoft website and downloading the trial version first (which *is* the Deluxe version). It has a two month lifespan, which is perfectly adequate for figuring out whether you will like the product or not. I've spent the last two days mucking around with it and I really like what I see. I like the 'dashboard' functionality where you set up all your account details, portfolios etc, and then Money will tell you which stocks are doing well, doing badly etc. I am very wary of linking bank accounts directly into the internet, so in the meantime I'm just downloading stock information. It is a bit limited on the international stocks side, and the US product is (surprise surprise) catered for US tax law and US investments (eg: 401K). But I would expect that this would all come in handy for someone actually from the US. The best functionality in this product is definitely the dashboard, cash flow and budgeting facilities. Basically every time I log into Money, it updates itself with the latest Money updates (ie: patches etc) and stock values, and tells me at a glance how everything is going. I'd give it five stars, but there are minor gaps in the functionality - like you can't import historical share data if the share isn't on the MSN listings. But this is very minor. It is definitely designed for you to set up all your accounts, all your shares and bonds, set up all the links into the internet to get current prices/values/balances, and then periodically monitor and update as you require.

"(Updated 4-11-2007 and 4-29-2007 to reflect new information on my Parallels crash, as well as the new version that fixes some of the cons I originally posted.)

I just got Parallels today and this review offers you a first impression of what it is like to install and use.  First you launch Parallels.  The Parallels screen opens, and displays some key preferences that you'll probably want to edit (see tips below). Clicking the play button (like a movie) you launch Windows (XP in my case) which boots on my iMac in about 10 seconds. In the Parallels window, Windows looks just like you are ""booting"" it yet the Mac is running the whole time!  I switch between the Mac and Windows using ""command+tab"" (that's the ""open apple"" for you hardcore Mac'ers).  Here are some pros and cons as well as some tips.

Pro:
-Install of Parallels went smoothly... the set up was automated, and went quickly with little or no decision-making
-Scary how much my Mac acts like a Windows PC
-Windows install included immediate access to the internet through my Mac account, a huge surprise
-So far SUPERIOR to VirtualPC, which after hours and hours, I never got working... Parallels was so easy.
-All my peripherals seem to work, even my Sony mouse which has a memory stick slot in it (in other words, it's multi-functional/fancy and was supported nicely)
-I use my Mac to safely browse the internet and download programs... I even downloaded office for Windows on my Mac and then used Parallels to retrieve it (I could have used Parallels to get it directly, but then I'd have to browse using Windows and risk viruses)
-Share files very easily between the OSX (Mac) and Windows using a shared folder (I've shared photos and a free yet massive Microsoft Office trial program this way, to test it).
-Automatically maps PC Control key functions over to Mac Command key... handy!

Con:
-Technical support is worse than any other tech group I have had to use... my Parallels was down 3 weeks and they didn't even call or email me once to let me know what the status of my problem is (or that the problem was even received).  I finally called them and waited 90 minutes although the system said it would be only 10.  Each time I moved ahead in the queue, the quoted wait time got longer!  When I got through, they were able to resolve the ""black screen"" problem quickly (launching XP produced a completely empty black window), apparently it was common.  My other problem was the ""install tools"" wasn't working, which means you can't share a folder between the Mac and XP.  In the short term I emailed files to myself as a poor man's method to share files, fortunately I was working with small ones.  Turns out that while the cause is still undetermined, I found a Parallels disk image on my drive which when manually clicked, manually launched the installer I needed.  Weird.
-To me, the instructions are weak, the manual is not very good and instructions that come with upgrades are terrible... you've been warned
-Seems a little slow at times.  I've bumped up the ""RAM"" allocation to 604 MB (max recommended), but think it may need even more.
-People report slow or incompatible gaming.

Tips (Neutral Commentary):
-I recycled an old copy of XP that was registered once, but no longer in use.  When registering, call Microsoft as your option.  I left them know that I was ""reinstalling the software.""  I didn't bother to tell them that I was installing to a Mac... I figured that this would generate a pointless and a lengthy discussion to a confused person in India.
-After installing XP, immediately seek out the updates.  This might require many ""reboots"" which in this case aren't reboots at all.  The program cycles yet your Mac OS is running the whole time!
-If it's not already obvious, you need a copy of Windows.
-Give it RAM!  The default of 256 KB is laughable and will produce frustratingly slow performance.
-This will work alongside Apple's free ""Boot Camp"" beta so you can have the convenience of Parallels with the computing speed/compatibility offered by Boot Camp (with Boot Camp you must reboot your computer to switch between .  Windows and your Mac OS). Just remember that when you call Microsoft to register Windows, your copy of Windows is being ""reinstalled on the same computer.""
-Have your Windows Virus protection handy to install immediately
-Set aside time to install of Microsoft's updates to maximize security and compatibility. In the first 3 days I installed 124 XP updates (yes, I counted them, all 124 of them) from the Microsoft web site... you'll need to reboot XP many times to do this.
-My extended keys (i.e. the number pad area to the right) is activated using the ""clear"" key which is in the same position as the ""num lock"" would be... many functions behave like this automatically as described in the ""pro"" section above

Bottom line: Excellent, wonderfully handy! Amazing to see Windows XP coexisting with my Mac OS.

"I had the 2009 Internet security version, tried the 2010 version as part of a free upgrade, didn't like certain problems, so went back to 2009.

I purchased renewal licenses for the 2009, then I get a message from Kaspersky a few days ago to the effect that Kaspersky will no longer provide daily definition updates, but that I can use my unexpired license time (about three months in my case) towards a newer version.

I download the 2012 version, enter my current key/license number and Kaspersky doesn't recognize that number or previous numbers.

I'm willing to eat three months if the trial 2012 version works okay.

NOT.

I have the three license version.  Full scan is reasonably fast on an ancient Windows XP desktop and a three-year old Vista desktop.  However, my Vista OS laptop with a dual-core AMD processor (not a performance star by any means, but not a total dog) takes about 18 hours to finish the scan of about 120 gigs of data.  This is with me not using the laptop and shutting down as many other programs as feasibly possible.

Fine.  Supposedly, Kaspersky has the software set up so that it won't look at the same files on subsequent scans if iList and/or iCheck is activated--which they are.

So now, while multitasking, Kaspersky is telling me it will need 5 days for the next full scan.

I decide to look at the Kaspersky forums--and I'm reminded of previous unpleasant experiences, namely receiving messages of ""flooding"" when I attempt a search.

This is way too much nonsense for one program.

I will not use Norton due to unethical practices in which they've engaged concerning previous purchases, but I will find something less aggravating than Kaspersky.","Slow scans, too many other problems",False,1324944000,1.0986122886681098,0.0

"I've been using QuickBooks for over 10 years (started on version 4, I think) and just upgraded to 2011 from 2006. I have a VERY small business and don't actually use most of the functions of the software, but I needed some specific functions that Quicken or other accounting applications were unable to provide. Yes, it is more complex than Quicken, but it does a lot more.

The common functions that I use -- Create Invoices, Pay Bills, Item List, Account Ledger -- look about the same as 2006.

The install was incredibly simple via drag-n-drop to my Applications folder. Of the features that are ""new to me"" (though probably in previous versions): The ""Home Page"" makes some items that I commonly use easier to find than digging through menus. The Customer/Vendor lists are much better designed and more Mac-like than 2006, and I'm very excited about the Report Center which now provides images of sample reports, so you know what you're getting versus picking something by name and hoping it's correct. The UI for the Preferences window has also been updated to look more Mac-like, modeled on the OS X System Preferences window. I also set up and run an iDisk backup for the first time and it worked perfectly.

Otherwise, my 2006 data file converted without error and I find the general interface of the application to be very responsive.

If you have 2010, it's probably not worth upgrading unless there's specific new features (or bug fixes) that you're looking for -- I didn't see anything compelling to me listed on the box.

Give this game a try.  It is fun for kids and adults alike. My 11 & 13 year olds both defeated the game before I did, but then they both played it again with different strategy trying to beat their scores.  It also does not go on forever and ever in long boring quests.  It is a quick game that has doable levels and rewards as it moves along and keeps the player's interest.
Plus a few of the characters have little tidbits of trivia about chocolate history, so it is *mildly* educational.

I think this is a game that can be put away and revisited later and still give good play value.  The quests are just enough random that the game is not too overly predictable.

!! HOWEVER !!  We did experience a mid-game crash under OS 10.4.11.  I contacted the company via email and they responded quickly.  This is a known bug in the CD copy.  The cure for the crash is to download the online Mac version of the trial game over the already installed CD version..... that patched it up like a charm and it ran perfectly from that moment on.... the crash turned out to be a minor hiccup in game play.

"My consulting business is based on time billing, and now I can bill time, invoice by email, and track conversations ALL from Outlook. If I schedule an appointment, or track my time in Outlook, I can mark the time as billable, create an entry, and the info flows directly into my accounting software.
My ability to invoice by email had expired with QuickBooks, so I had switched to using PDFRedirect to print pdf files instead and emailed them. I was not eager to spend hundreds of dollars on an upgrade, when what I had was working fine until one of their updates turned off a feature I needed. Now it's not a problem, and the new solution actually works better because I can run the whole time billing side of my consulting business from Outlook.
I had recently tried SugarCRM, but the open source version doesn't handle billing. Small Business Accounting 2006 has the best features of CRM, with Opportunity tracking, what's in the pipeline, etc. PLUS the best features of QuickBooks for considerably less.

"Was able to activate Microsoft Office 2016 Home & Student. Just a note to anyone having a problem with this Product Key, you must have a Microsoft account to use it.  First set up a Microsoft Account. Also, the software must be downloaded and installed first into your computer. The only function of a Product Key is to activate the software once it has been installed in your computer.

My computer came pre-installed with a trial version of Office 365, which is a subscription-based software.  As I did not want to pay every year for Office, I decided instead to get a permanent installation of Office 2016 Home & Student. Upon entering the Product Key number, I was prompted to activate Office 2016 Home & Student instead of Office 365, and this seems to have worked out fine.

Upon starting up Word or Excel, I see a brief ""Office 365"" logo on the screen, and then it opens Word 2016 or Excel 2016 instead.

I have downloaded the LiveEval disk from SUSE, and have installed 9.1 on no less than 3 completely different systems from the same CD... they are:

Each and every install performed flawlessly.  I had no problems with any of the included software, and every piece of hardware on all systems was found and configured correctly with the following exceptions:
Sound cards were not always recognized.  However, after telling Yast to re-probe the hardware (one time) everything worked correctly.  Also, still working on finding video drivers from ATI, however, you can download them free on ATI's web site.
I was very pleased with the installer, KDE interface, the software included, and the overall experience of all of the installs.
some more tips:
1) Like other reviewers here have said over and over again, do your homework BEFORE you try installing this.  Make sure your hardware is supported, or if it's not, decide if this is something you would be willing to live with while running Linux.
2) Download and install the Live Eval disk from [...] -  while this will not give you a 100% complete picture of how your system will function, it will give you enough information upon which you can base an informed decision.  Remember: the live eval is free (and will not change your hard drive whatsoever).  Your time/frustration/windows partitions are not free.
3) If at all possible, DON'T INSTALL LINUX IN THE SAME PARTITION AS WINDOWS!!

"Dragon for Mac has internal conflicts with Word for Mac that causes computer crashes and SLOWNESS.  I have recommended to Amazon that they stop selling this product because it is defective.  I did not have problems with SLOW Mac or Mac CRASHING before I added Dragon to my Mac.

I had a MacBook and bought Dragon 2 for Mac and the problems began.  The problem was when I used Dragon and Word, XL and Photoshop were open.

Mac tech support (via tel and Genius Bar) tried to figure out the problem.  Over more than a year trying to FIX the problem under AppleCare: Apple reloaded my operating system, Nuance reloaded Dragon, Apple told me to buy more RAM - bought 4 GB more on top of the 4 I had, Apple told me to buy a powered USB hub (I did; I need a 'natural' keyboard and mouse)... problem still not fixed after each of these attempted fixes.

NEXT Apple thought maybe my hard drive was failing and they replaced my hard drive.  NEXT the speculation was that since my MacBook was older - maybe the processor was too slow.  Nuance said that Dragon 3 was more efficient and buying DD3 would help. To use DD3, I needed to upgrade my operating system on the MacBook or buy a new Mac.

FINALLY a bought a new MacMini with Mountain Lion and bought DD3 from Amazon.  Now, I have faster core processor, newer MAC OS, and newer DD3.  At the advice of Apple - I did NOT move applications from the old computer to the new.  All apps were installed on the Mini directly from original CDs.  Photoshop 4 discs are hiding somewhere in my office so I bought mini-photo edit software SnapHeal, Pixelmator, etc.to replace PhotoShop.  I was NEVER a power PS user... but this added MORE COST to solving my Dragon Dictate for Mac problem.

You guessed it - NEW COMPUTER - NEW OS - NEW DD3 - same problem with computer crashing and grinding to a halt.

Last night, I took the new computer to the Apple Store and the Genius Bar technician opened: Applications>Utilities>Activity Monitor and we watched Word, XL, Pixelmator all work properly.  Then we opened Dragon Dictate - all still fine except Word went NUTS - using 104% of the CPU capacity - even when nothing was being dictated and on and on. The mini also ran HOT to the touch when Dragon was loaded - not good for the computer.

Having problems with Dragon Dictate 2 or 3 for MAC crashing and slowing your computer?  GO TO Applications > UTILITIES > Activity Monitor... LOOK at Word's CPU usage when Dragon is Loaded.  SEE the problem right before your eyes.

"I purchased Adobe Premiere Elements 12 a ways back, and also have Corel Video Studio Pro X8. I acquired Cyberlink Power Director 14 Ultimate because of its compatibility with Windows 10. As the description states, World's Fastest Rendering -TrueVelocity 5 leverages hardware and software technologies to speed up video processing and outperform all others. TrueVelocity is optimized for modern CPU and GPGPU hardware platforms from Intel, AMD and NVIDIA to maximize memory allocation and usage. So it is compatible with all three manufacturers Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA of display adapters.
My Adobe Premiere Elements 12 is not compatible with Windows 10, at least not in every function, but fortunately Corel Video Studio Pro X8 has released a free update to 8.5 which is. This Cyberlink Power Director 14 is being released as a designed for Windows 10 piece of software from the get go.

When I first got Corel X8 I was pleased that it had an easy-peasy video editor option that made it a candy walk to create a video right out of the box. This Cyberlink Director 14 has an equivalent easy editor. That probably has a lot to do with the instant results, and wall to wall 5 star reviews of those stating how easy it is to use out of the box. Others who delve into the more complex functions of video editing, and are frustrated that they cannot master it right away are those who are slamming the software with low star ratings. If you want a fully featured program that does incredible things, and enables you to do things that you simply cant do with for example Windows Movie Maker then there is going to be a learning curve.

The thing I love the most about CPD 14 is that you can edit this with 4 different camera angles. I have multiple high def. cameras, some more expensive than others, and I know how great it is to have different angles to capture the excitement of a scene. When a scene is captured using just one angle it creates boredom for the viewing audience. Having a multiple method option for synchronizing all 4 whether it be automatically through the audio track, or by markers that you can set and tweak using right and left arrows controlling individual frames etc. is an option that is worth the price of admission.

Much is said about the lack of an owners manual and not without merit. But with the price of the manual to print, and then the large increase in shipping such a product compared to a simple disc in a light box it makes the lack thereof a smart move. Having a digital manual is just as convenient except for those who stubbornly hold onto having to have a book on the desk. To be honest I wish all of my books were scanned so my entire library would take up zero shelf space in the FireHDX. With the split screen in Windows 8 + you can divide a good sized monitor into the right half, and left half, and operate both programs at once without even having to bring them back up; they just stay there. Anyhow you shouldnt have to change your computer in order to use some software but on the other hand all software these days doesnt come with a written manual so get over it.

A really cool tool is all of the videos you can find on You Tube where they take you through certain functions right on the screen. There is no better learning tool than to see it being done. A picture really does say a thousand words. Also Cyberlink has online help both in the way of information, as well as providing a forum that is filled with information from those who have been using the program, and are willing to help. So you can look something up quickly, or even make your own post about how to do something, and watch the CL community come to the rescue.

Right now this is #9 in video editing software in the ASRs - Amazon Sales Ranks. Thats a lofty spot because every other contributor in video editing software above it are all cheapy versions. So this is the number 1 video editor over $100; that is saying something. It even beats out Adobe Photoshop & Premiere Elements in the over one hundred dollar category. Right now it is actually priced the same.
It comes with 2 discs containing more extra add-ons then you could ever use. They are offered to you individually when you load the program, or should I say after loading the program, they want you to do that first. So if you don't want the wedding videographer suite of tools you don't have to load them.

No wonder it earned PC Magazines Editors Choice award beating out all others. In the words of PC magazine, BOTTOM LINE- Power Director continues to outflank the competition, with top rendering speed, a massive set of video editing tools, the latest file-standard support, and a wealth of new features in its latest update.""

 Awesome upgrade, October 29, 2009

I knew from the day that I installed the Windows pre-beta copy of Windows 7 that I received at a Microsoft event almost a year ago that Windows 7 was going tos bea huge improvement over Vista and XP. The first machine that I installed it on was a Lenovo T43 laptop. This machine could not reasonably run Vista (from a clean install)...I could not even surf the web on it. I installed a clean version of 32-bit Win7 on this machine and it turned it into a new machine. I did not have to download a single driver to get it to work and the whole install took less than a half an hour. Now this machine is perfectly functioning and I can use it to surf the web and stream youtube videos, etc. If you want to take full advantage of all the graphical elements in Windows 7 you will need more hardware power, but the point is that Windows 7 tends to upgrade your machine because of all the incremental performance enhancements that were made to the operating system.

I have installed Windows 7 on probably about 20 machines in the last year and I have not had any issues with it not installing drivers. That is good because I suggest you do a clean install. When I decided to upgrade my office machine back in August I used the File and Setting Transfer Wizard to back up all my programs and settings to a external drive and then did a clean install, then restore my programs and settings. This worked better than I expected it would. Almost everything I needed was where it should have been. The few things that were missing still could be found on my hard drive. I ran into one problem where I tried to upgrade from Vista to Windows 7. There was a problem late into the install process that force the Windows 7 install to be rolled back. It is due do some driver/service/hardware not acting the way it should that causes this, but it is happening to a few people out there I know. The good thing is that if there is a problem like this your original OS is restored perfectly.

There is not a lot of new features in the operating system. Some of my favorites are the new mobile broadband (cellular) integration into the wireless network user interface. You don't have to install a cumbersome application from the cellular card maker anymore (if you have a card that supports the new driver model) and you cellular driver doesn't install all the extra COM ports. Also, I really like how they handle the taskbar when you have more than one of the same application running. When you click on it you get a small screenshot of the application (if you have the aero theme support, otherwise it is more textual). This also works great with IE, because all the tabs are show no matter how many instances of IE are running at the same time. I hated trying find tabs if you have multiple instances of IE running that multiple tabs open in each of them...this problem is fixed now. Finally, XP mode is a nice feature that you can have with a little setup work. It allow you to run a virtual XP machine inside Windows 7. It takes a little work to setup and doesn't run you application as fast as they would natively. You need a faster CPU and extra memory if you plan on using this a lot. But, hopefully the average user doesn't need to use this.

So far, I have not found any application that ran on Vista that don't run on Windows 7.

Also, if you plan on using more than 3 GB of RAM you need to buy a 64-bit version of Windows 7.

I needed to renew my subscription to Norton 360, and decided to go with Norton Security Premium based on the very clear statement that it could protect up to 10 devices, including iOS.  After downloading NS Premium on my computers, I started to download the iOS app, but then noticed the Apple Store reviews that complained about NS not providing anything for iPhones and iPads except for backup of contacts and ""find my device"" capability--both of which are already provided by Apple.  This is extremely deceptive, and cost me an additional $6 over the $34.99 I would have spent for 15 months of NS Deluxe on Amazon.  I contacted Norton and they extended my subscription by an additional 36 days (30 days plus the 6 days I had remaining on my 360 subscription when I activated the NS Premium).  Nice of them, but the deceptive advertising speaks very poorly of Norton, and frankly makes me suspect of their corporate integrity.

"I am a long-term Quicken user and found the product to be about the same as 2010.  One major loss, however, is the budgeting process.  The budget is now much more difficult to use and the overall perspective is almost eliminated.  It is much less effective as a management tool.  In Quicken 2010, the ability to see the overall, but drill down to detail was very good.  Now one must generate a separate budget report just to get any sense of the overall budget.  There are some totals shown, but even they do not add up, a embarrassing flaw for a financial program.  In short, the budget is poorly executed.

I actually bought Norton Internet Security 2007 but couldn't get to install it on Vista; so returned it.

I went online to the onecare.live.com site to download the trial version. it installed in a breeze without any issues.

"Now I didn't buy Windows 8 Pro from Amazon, actually. I bought it from Microsoft, and had a discount from the Windows Upgrade Offer (Got my copy for my Acer Aspire M5-581T, which is eligible for this offer). I was glad I got Windows 8 Pro because I was able to get Windows Media Center free of charge after the upgrade, and still be able to play DVDs on this laptop.

The upgrade process, I will tell you, was pretty rough, and man I mean rough. I did get an error while it was copying files but it continued to install (maybe a minor glitch), it rebooted, and Windows 8 got everything set up. No BSODs or anything (thank god). Thankfully, it did keep every setting I had on like the upgrade promised. I gone ahead and checked to make sure everything worked (drivers and anything else like that). Almost everything worked, except the Wi-Fi. That's right, the internet stopped working after the upgrade, and was the only real way to activate Windows. The Wi-Fi driver reinstall stalled while in the normal Windows environment, but in Safe Mode (which the method to get into that has changed, btw, no longer are we hitting F8 to open that faithful menu to bring us Safe Mode), the drivers installed fully, and I rebooted into the normal environment, and the internet worked once again. Sound worked, but the lil piece that came with my laptop for the sound, Dolby Home Theater, didn't. Had to uninstall that and reinstall. Graphics drivers were ones shipped from Microsoft, and I swapped that as fast as possible with proper drivers. Everything went back to normal, and my computer adjusted to Windows 8. The OS was completely stable after that.

Using the OS took some getting used to. Luckily I was able to try out the Release Preview on a virtual machine before getting the final release to get a chance to play with the new interface, the Metro UI and stuff like that. I know most were complaining that Microsoft removed the Start button from the taskbar and the old start menu, and replaced that with the Metro Start Menu (or Start Screen), and I know how that feels, but hey, given patience, using the Start Screen in Windows 8 will be as intuitive as using the old-fashioned Start Menu in previous versions, plus this at least gives the OS some more eye candy, and I'm also quick to adapt to new things. It's kind of sad though that Microsoft removed certain pieces from Aero in Windows 8 (ahem, Aero Glass), but I gotten used to that and it doesn't bother me too much now. Having the ability to snap apps on the side of the screen is pretty nifty. Say that you're typing up something in Microsoft Word, you can have, say the Music app, on one side of the screen and be able to control what song you're listening to and all of that. Windows Store is already getting an abundance of apps being made for Windows 8, which is good, and hopefully spur more development from others to create something for Windows.

Overall, I actually like Windows 8. The OS is completely different, but it is rock-solid stable, and a fun OS to play with. Also, since the days of Windows 95, the Windows OS has looked almost the same in terms of construction, and Windows 8 pretty much gave Windows a new coat of paint. the UI looks better than it has in years, and I applaud Microsoft for that, but I do ask why they removed certain elements of Aero. I've used Windows since 98, and for being part of a generation that now are using Android, iOS, etc., I felt that Windows 8 was a little off, but this is why Microsoft did what they did with this OS - the way computing is done is changing. More people are buying tablets and smartphones and using them more than PCs. Microsoft needed to make something like this to keep up with the jonses. Sure you can say that Microsoft is copying Apple, but this hasn't been the first time they did that. Plus, I'd like Microsoft to succeed in the tablet computing space, and Windows 8 is the key. Is this OS good? No. I think Microsoft could've done better, but is it stable? Hell yes. I'd say that Windows 8 is just about as stable as Windows 7 if not better. Could this OS succeed? Probably, given time, but this is my own opinion. All I can say is, despite the controversy surrounding this OS and the radical changes done on this OS, I actually like Windows 8, and this OS is a winner in my book. If it weren't for the rough upgrade process, I would've given this 5 stars.","Rough upgrade process, but stable and fun in the end",False,1356220800,1.6094379124341005,1.0

A wiser publisher would not tie themselves to the whims of Adobe to make their product function.

Since update to Win 10 this will not even load. Crashes on start.

"I have been running Star Office 6.0 since the beta program began, and I love this software.  I found the word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation package to be so compelling, I uninstalled Microsoft's product.  In other words, Sun has a Microsoft killer on it's hands.
There are a handful of MS-Office features that Star Office lacks (most importantly: the ability to handle embedded OLE objects such as VISIO).  But there is also a bundle of nice touches that StarOffice adds that do MS one better.  The user interface is fast, slick, and powerful.  After using it for a few months, I found the UI to be preferable it to MS Office -- though this is a matter of personal taste.
I have found Star Office to be fast, reliable, and compatible.  I love the fact that I can start a document at work, on UNIX, and finish it up at home on Windows, without a hiccup.  StarOffice is so cheap, IT managers ought to be fired if they don't at least consider StarOffice for their corporate desktops.  The licensing policy that allows a single user to run StarOffice on a variety of machines (home, work, and laptop, anyone?) is like a breath of fresh air compared to Microsoft's End User Agreement.
I haven't played much with the integrated database, or with the photo editting application that was not part of the beta program.  I do like the integrating drawing package, which I now use instead of VISIO for all of my diagramming.

"Now that I have everything set up and am using QB regularly, I really like it. It is an integrated system, not just a glorified checkbook register. Estimates, invoices, purchase orders, client contact info, A/P, A/R, etc.--they're all interlinked, and QB comes loaded with all the reports, forms, etc. that I need to see my business's status from any perspective at any time, almost instantly. Customizing the forms to fit my needs was not difficult. And you have options for turning on or off automatic help features to fit your level of accounting knowledge, so you're not interrupted by ""help"" if you don't need it. My existing Quicken files were converted and integrated into the new QB setup flawlessly, so there was no time spent on repeat data entry, either.

But I have to say, getting to this point was a bit of a trial.

First, the installation instructions are at times misleading. The most extreme example is this, from the FAQs: ""To use QuickBooks, you must have Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 installed. If you do not have any version of Microsoft Internet Explorer on you system, you can download...."" I was irritated to read this because the system and software requirements list provided before you buy does NOT mention IE. I am a Firefox convert and removed IE long ago but decided to attempt installation anyway. Turns out QB works just fine without IE. I can't fathom why that is in the FAQs.

Second, it takes a while before you're just allowed to use the software unaccosted. The first bunch of times QB is opened, it pops up a sales window for other related products. And you're not given the choice to opt out of email marketing until *after* you've received the first few emails. Thankfully, the up-sell appears to be a temporary annoyance. I haven't seen one of those ad windows for a while now, and ""unsubscribe"" was effective. QB also pressures you repeatedly in the beginning to join the online user forum. While it's great to know the forum is there if I should run into trouble, the vast majority of the time I don't want to be invited to hang around a forum just because I have a transaction to record. Thankfully again, those repeated invitations also ceased after maybe half a dozen times opening QB.

"This is my first time using the Turbo Tax line of tax preparation software in over a decade.  I have been a loyal H&R Block software user for many years.  I thought I would give Turbo Tax a try after being away from it for a number of years.

There is nothing really extra ordinary in the taxes I prepare.  My taxes mainly consist of work income, interest, dividend, and investment sales.  I have a mortgage and pay property taxes on several parcels of land.  I have a relative that lives in Alaska that I help with their taxes, so I do deal with the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend payout and retirement income there.

Loading the software onto a PC was quite easy, though it did seem to take a bit of time to load.  I imported my H&R Block tax return into Turbo Tax without any issues at all.

Updating last years information and entering new information into Turbo Tax was easy and for the most part uneventful. The only thing I really did not like with the Turbo Tax software was that it was not obvious where to enter the Alaskan Permanent Fund Dividend information for federal taxes where in the H&R Block software it was much more obvious.

Comparing my experiences between H&R Block and Turbo Tax, I found both programs to be very similar and both to be very easy to use.  Personally, if I have to choose between the two, it would 100% come down to price.  For the 2014 software, I would need Turbo Tax Premium to deal with investment income or H&R Block Deluxe.  At the time of this review, H&R Block Deluxe is about half the price of Turbo Tax Premium.  While the Turbo Tax software does the job just fine, it really seems to be a poor value for the money.  H&R Block Deluxe is a very similar product, does just as good of a job, and the cost is half as much.

Unless you have a strong attachment to Turbo Tax for some reason, I would recommend passing on this product and picking up H&R Block software.","Easy To Use, Got The Job Done, But There Is A Much Less Costly Alternative On The Market",False,1423440000,0.0,0.0

"Overall, Turbotax Premier is still a very useful program, but it has lost some of its luster. On the plus side, it has the following going for it:

-It is still easy to use and simplifies your taxes.  Turbotax Premier guides you through even complex returns, including joint returns with multiple Schedule Cs.

-It now includes ItsDeductible, which sold separately last year,  for free. This nifty little program stores all of your charitable donation information and provides valuations for your non-cash donations. It will save you a bundle if you donate clothing.

-Although somewhat hidden, (why, I don't know) ItsDeductible now gives you the option of storing your 2006 charitable donations online on its web site throughout the year for free. Presumably, when you get around to doing you '06 taxes you will then automatically download this info into you ItsDeductible 2006 program.

-It includes a free state download. Last year you had to buy the state program separately and send in a refund coupon. Intuit has (thankfully) decided to just go ahead and bundle the state program.

-The 2005 version is better at deciding which sections to skip. Previous versions were not very good at deciding what to skip and what to go over, in my experience.

On the downside, this year's Turbotax Premier has several drawbacks that make is somewhat less user-friendly than last year's version:

-Navigation, as other reviewers have noted, is too linear and makes the program a drag to use if you need to update specific items. ***There is a work-around, however.*** Go to the ""Tools"" menu and select ""See Topic List."" You will then see the old navigation window from last year, which allows you to jump to specific areas of your return.  Why Intuit hid this feature away, I don't know.

-The one-click updates feature is buggy. I had problems with it on two computers.  On one of them, it would hang after downloading 12% of ANY update, including the free state product. I had to disable Zone Alarm, NAV, and the Windows firewall, then click over to a part of the return that would trigger a download to get it to work (even then, it wouldn't work by selecting the menu item directly).

-The IRA section doesn't tell you up front if you are eligible for a Roth or traditional IRA. It first asks you if you have made or plan to make any IRA contributions, and only later in the filing process does it tell you that (surprise!) you can't make contributions to an IRA. You then have to manually go back and erase your IRA contributions (if you haven't already made them, that is!) to set things right. This is poor planning on Intuit's part. The program should first crunch the numbers to see if you are eligible, and only then ask if you want to fund an IRA.

-There is no coupon for one free federal e-filing. The price has not gone up, but you won't get it for free. TaxCut still has free e-filing, by the way.

Out of morbid curiosity (or a love of pain, I don't know) I also used a free version of TaxCut basic to prepare the same return (a relatively ""simple"" full 1040 with itemized deductions). While it's not fair to compare the basic version of TaxCut to the high-end, expensive Turbotax Premier, I do think that Turbotax is still somewhat easier to use and uses more approachable language to explain tax issues.  In addition, Turbotax has a much wider selection of downloadable 1099s and W-2s than TaxCut.

I know some reviewers have experienced calculation errors with Turbotax. All I can say is that both Turbotax and TaxCut gave the exact same results for the return I prepared.

As for the state version, I used Turbotax to prepare my VA return but then used Virginia's very good (and free) Web filing site to submit my return. Both Turbotax and the Virginia e-filing site churned out very similar figures. The differences between the two resulted from Turbotax's rounding off all numbers to the nearest dollar, while Virginia's site kept track of every penny. If you want to save yourself the state e-filing fee, you may want to check with your state tax agency to see if it offers free e-filing on its own. It's a bit more work, but you can use the state return prepared by Turbotax as a cheat sheet.","Several improvements, but not as good as last year's version",False,1139961600,2.6390573296152584,0.0

"Buyer beware.  I tried to convert from quicken for windows (2013 edition).  very non-intuitive overly complex process.  Have to download a separate converter, etc.  It's pretty pathetic that intuit can't make a more user friendly process to move data from the PC to the mac version of it's own software.

Once moved 2/3 of my bank accounts could not connect.  Hours of time with chat support and many ""Workarounds"" later the banks connected without error.  Next day noticed although no connection errors, no transactions were being downloaded, although there were new posted transactions when I checked my bank online.  Looks like it doesn't have the capability to auto reconcile when you download transactions similar to the windows version.  To reconcile you have to have a start date, end date, start balance, end balance and then select transactions etc.  In the windows version it did this automatically every time you downloaded transactions.  You matched your transactions and it reconciled to the online balance.

I am searching vigorously for a replacement for quicken (continue to use windows version until then).  My needs are simple,  enter transactions manually, download transactions from bank to match to what I've entered, reconcile with online balance.  That's it.  Hard to find anything else that really does that.

"I'm torn as to whether to give AIDA 64 Extreme 3 or 4 stars.  Ultimately, based on my intended use and the software's functionality, I go with 3 stars.  Whether I would recommend you purchase this product depends on your desired uses.  I purchased AIDA 64 with the intent to monitor various aspects of my computer (temps, clock speeds, fan speeds, etc.).  I particularly wanted something that had on OSD (on screen display) option.

Pros:
- Copious info on your computer from temps (CPU, CPU package, individual CPU cores, motherboard, GPU, etc.) to memory usage.  If there's info that you want on your computer, you can probably find and/or monitor it with AIDA 64 extreme.
- Fairly good user interface, with one exception (in my opinion).

Cons:
- The OSD cannot be displayed in-game, severely limiting it's usefulness to check temps, etc. when you're gaming.
- The software's use of the sensors conflicts with my Asus software's use of the sensors.  This led to erroneous readings in my Asus software, including an erroneous voltage reading that led to a hard shutdown of my computer due to the Asus anti-surge protection.  I would just get rid of the Asus software, but I use it to control my fans.  AIDA64 doesn't control fans.
- The OSD and desktop displays are buried under ""file"" --> ""preferences"".  It's odd that they don't get their own drop-down in the main screen like the benchmarking tools do.

The first 2 cons listed seriously limit the usefulness of this software for me. I'll still get some use out of the great depth of info it provides and perhaps will try out the benchmarking/stress test tools.  This software might be more useful for others, such as if they want to use it mostly for the benchmarking tools included (which I haven't explored yet since that wasn't my main focus in purchasing this software), aren't using other software that reads the same sensors, and/or don't care about in-game OSD.",Issues limit usefulness for me despite copious info on computer,True,1414195200,1.3862943611198906,0.0

"I would not recommend Quickbooks to anyone for several reasons.

I -- On the technical side

1) the Quickbooks 2014 for Mac is often very slow in its process. I had to turn on and off my computer several times, and I just got extra Ram memory on my laptop.
2) There is not a clear explanation on how to download bank transactions, how to add online banking, and then make sure that when the qbo files are downloaded, they will connect to the correct bank. The last time I tried, I had to go into the qbo file and delete the last digit of the account ID, and it was really inconvenient. That whole setup needs more explanation to someone who is non-technical.

II -- On the customer service side, I am extremely dissatisfied with the amount of time it took to resolve my issue (1 hrs and 30 minutes). The representative did not want to help me because I had to PAY to get help. Why would I have to pay when it is YOUR software that is the problem? When I have already paid over $250 for a piece of software, I expect it to work seamlessly without too much issue. I even hired a professional bookkeeper, and both of us could not figure out how to connect the downloaded transaction to the right bank account. It was extremely frustrating. So, the representative simply sent me the online instructions, and I made sure that he was on the phone with me. He was just leaving me, hanging there on phone, without assisting me at all.

You guys just wasted 1 hr and 30 minutes of MY time AND 1 hr of 30 minutes of your company time. This problem could have been explained to me in less than 10 minutes, and that would've been the end of the call. INSTEAD, he had to go FIND the article, email it to me, and wait for me to open it, read it, and process it in my brain.  Then, he was sitting there and waiting for me to figure it out on my own, without doing anything proactive on his part. I am glad that I had some technical background and figured this out quickly. Otherwise, it would've not been resolved.

So, overall, I give the software and the customer very low regard. The representative's name was Bobby. Obviously, I have no idea which country he is from, and I had a very hard time understanding his accent. He even questioned ME by saying, ""Are you on a speaker phone?"" No, I was on the line with my ear right next to the phone, trying my best to listen to what he had to tell me in resolving the problem. At the end, I had to basically read the instructions while I made him stay there.

Very poor level of customer service from Intuit. Even the supervisor had a low level of competency and tried to explain to me that it was not their problem. This was somehow MY problem.  How is it MY problem that your software could not connect the correct qbo files to the right bank account?  Is that how you guys are trying rip extra money off of your customers?

"It's ok. It burns data disks. But windows burns data disks. It burns images. Just google ""iso recorder powertoy"" and you'll find a great free iso burner (works in 8 great even though it only mentions through windows 7). It lets you copy disks (which you can do with the free iso recorder). It lets you burn music cds--doesn't media player do that as part of windows? So the first half of the program does stuff with disks, but who needs more than free to do this? It does fine doing all these things, but it's not amazing. It's kinda clunky.

Then it lets you edit movies and edit movie dvds. It is easier than Premier Elements, but I prefer Premier still because I have more options. It does this ok, but you can't burn Bluray disks in this version. To be honest, again there isn't much more that this does than the free Windows Movie Maker does... And if you really need more than Movie Maker, you probably need Premier Elements for the real next step up.

And I guess the biggest problem is that the whole program is a relic from the past. I burn probably 10 disks a year. I don't remember the last time I made a music CD. I do make a dvd a year for grandma, but I already have Adobe Premier Elements for that. And most people just upload to youtube! There has to be a smaller and smaller market for this. I mean most ultrabooks don't even come with disk drives! I'm sure there's not enough money to make a better and better program here--just enough money to churn out a new version every year with slight improvements.

And it definitely is a better program than the version I used a few years back and crashed all the time. But now that Creator has arrived to the party in good condition, the party's winding down...

Additional info 1/24/2014: So I needed to burn a .img disk image that I downloaded from the Microsoft Office site. It's a disk download of Microsoft Office for my friend with really slow internet. I've seen .img files before so I know that extension is not unheard of, and I assume that since Microsoft is using it that it's a normal image type. Well, Roxio doesn't recognize it as a disk image format. But the free iso recorder powertoy does.

She liked all the ""fun"" activities, decorating her virtual cabin, teaching tricks to her virtual pet cat, planting virtual flowers, sliding down virtual slides, and just walking her character around and looking at the 3D world, as well as the more properly educational activities.

Where I have a big problem with this company is their marketing strategy.  What you're buying in this package is only a DEMO.  Your child can do the first 2 levels of the game, gets hooked into collecting badges, and then gets a stern message that her parents must go to Jumpstart's website to buy a membership.  It costs $8/month or $75/year.  My big complaint is that nowhere on the box does it say that this product is only a DEMO.  You don't even realize that the software contains only 2 of the 12 levels until your child completes the second level and begs you to buy the rest.  This is deceptive and unethical marketing, and I will not do business with a company that tries to fool people this way.  It's too bad because this would be a great educational tool.  I suppose this is what we get when ""for-profit"" motivations take precedence over ethical, educational and pedagogical considerations.

"It's easy for those who are used to the levels of complexity involved with Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop to proclaim them to be superior to any and all other similar products. However, for those who are not as tech savvy as your more current webcomic artists, graphic designers, or other aspiring digital artists, there comes another product that is far more approachable than the Adobe line of products, yet still has the potential to equal the power of the likes of Illustrator.

Corel products, in the past, have been very hit or miss. Sometimes you would be landed with a solid piece of software; other times you were left in an anticlimactic state of disdain over what was nothing more than a lackluster piling of clunky and poorly thought out features. X5 has managed to avoid this, focusing on everything from a better system of color management (proper grayscaling is now a possibility) to something that easily rivals a program I've fought with many times in the past; Adobe Bridge.

Indeed, Corel Connect is possibly the best new feature. While it lacks much of the customization that was permitted with coding in Adobe Bridge, Corel Connect has simplified the process. Often, the computer layman would beat on his or her keys in frustration trying to use Bridge, whereas Connect offers much the same end result on a simplified scale, allowing the quick transfer from CorelDraw to Photo-Paint (Corel's PhotoShop equivalent) simply and without extensive knowledge of file formats and coding.

Resizing and reshaping images in previous versions of CorelDraw was never fun, and the constant warping and unwanted glitches that would occur (especially when rounding the corners of rectangles) made the prospect of toying with any images not an option if you wanted to conserve your image. Colors, too, have gained an enormous degree of flexibility; the ability to play with shades and brightness has gone from overly simplistic to being simple to do, but with all the depth you would ever expect out of Illustrator.

The problems converting PNG are also gone and exporting to older formats in CorelDraw is now an actual option. It seems with this iteration, a lot of work was put into something that should be an obvious option.

But just scratching the surface of their big features, CorelDraw has started to catch up with Illustrator; newer brushes, better docking options, photo effects, tool tips that actually make sense, streamlined and logical hot keys, and image sprayer options that are absolutely delightful. CorelDraw is starting to come into its own, and one can only hope that future releases continue to refine a product that has long been sitting on the sideline watching Adobe take all the glory.

If you're looking for something without the learning curve of Illustrator and others, stop at CorelDraw. They might be finally finding their way.

"Not sure why some folks are having problems with restorals in this application.  Maybe it's because I'm a systems manager...maybe not.  I built a brand new tower this summer and loaded it with a Seagate 750GB SATA Drive as the primary OS drive.  The drive failed within 2 months (I should have stayed with Maxtor.)  Although the drive was under warranty and a replacement is on the way, I didn't feel like waiting for the drive to show up.  I got a 300GB Maxtor drive and popped it in.  My image is stored on an external 500GB drive.  Fired up Acronis and went to work.  It prompted me that the drive I wanted to use wasn't the same size and all it asked was if I wanted to use the 300GB drive and how much of it I wanted to use (all of it, of course.)  It asked me if I wanted to verify before restoring the image (I said yes, but be warned it can take 6 hours or more to verify before restoring) and I went to bed.  In the morning, it was all done and I rebooted the PC and all was right with the world.  Lost a couple of files because my last backup was 5 days before, but these things happen.  Say what you will, but Acronis did its job.

My only complaint is that the Try and Decide feature doesn't work with Vista Ultimate 64 Bit.  Acronis tech support said to uninstall/reinstall, but it still freezes up when I activate it.  If anyone knows how to get it working, I'd like to hear about it.  Not having that feature is not a deal breaker.  I wanted backup/recovery/imaging and this does it very well.

Weekly differential backups take up little space as well.

"Never, never, never go through Amazon for this.  Go to Adobe and get the subscription directly.  Amazon just cancelled my subscription because, they said, they decided not to support subscriptions with Adobe.  Before that, I spent cumulative tens of hours trying to get my subscriptions untangled.
Adobe was cancelling my software, saying it was about to expire.  Odd.  All my payments to Amazon were on time and current.  I called, and Amazon swore their paperwork was correct, which seemed to give them solace.  Adobe swore they didn't have any record of every being paid, and they were cancelling my subscription.  The conversation with Amazon went like this:

""I don't have my software.""
""But our paperwork is complete.  We've done what we can.  Amazon is done.""
""No, Amazon isn't done, because the deal isn't complete.  I paid you for stuff, but you haven't delivered it.""
""But we did our part.  The rest is Adobe's fault.""
""No, the problem is yours, because you took the money.""
""But our paperwork is complete!""

I only got my individual subscription working again through heroic work by the Amazon telephone help guy, but he went way beyond what anyone can expect.  Besides, nobody should have to spend 10 hours on the phone to get a simple subscription working.

"Worried by all the negative reviews but urged on by the repeated warnings from Quicken that my bank, credit card and investments would not be accessible after April 30, 2010, I waited till the very last minute to do the conversion from Quicken H&B 2007 to Quicken H&B 2010.

On April 30, the last day Quicken 2007 said it would do online updates, I first made sure that all my bills were paid. I did a final update of all my bank, credit card and investment accounts just before midnight on April 30. I then carefully backed up all my Quicken 2007 files to a folder that the new program would not find.

Just after midnight on May 1, 2010, I tried another update. As promised, it did not work. That part of the program was cut off at midnight on April 30, probably by an update to Quicken 2007 that arrived earlier in the day.

I said a little prayer, and inserted the Quicken H&B 2010 CD into my computer. It gently removed QW2007, installed QW2010, found my files, offered to store a copy of the original in case I wanted to go back to QW2007 and offered me a choice of which files to convert to the new format. By 12:30 am I was doing an update on all my files with the bank, credit cards, and investments.

The basics of doing the day to day work with the program remain the same but there are some interesting changes in appearance, information offered, and how different parts of the program are presented. I can see that there is a lot to learn, if I am interested.

Since I first discovered Quicken 4, at the suggestion of my accountant, I have updated every few years and been happy with the changes.

"I started trying Powerdirctor from its 5th version. PowerDirector has some nice features. But at every video task my kids and I tried to do, it has never been a smooth process.  It crashed so many times during the process that I had to save for each step. After you finally passed editing and authoring part, it started its very slow and long producing (generate MPEG file) part. You just pray it would not stop in the middle, and unfortunately it often did. And in the final burning stage (write to DVD), it can also stuck some where, which means you have to repeat the painful process again.

  The reason I still tried to use PowerDirector is that it is one of the few to allow me to drop my DVD Video Camera's file directly into the program.

"Don't Buy Microsoft Windows 10 Pro.

My first negative try at this review at Amazon was pulled because I recommend an alternative operating system. People need to be educated why Windows 10 Pro is a bad product. One -- the updates are data mining the user. Two --  if you have a hardware failure, buy replacement hardware and even if you have the original Windows branding code you will not be able to activate your system. One upgrade will shut it down! I build computers and have spent thousands of dollars on Amazon buying parts.

"This review is on the word processing, PDF, and eBook features, all of which are fabulous.

I.  WordPerfect is superior to Word for word processing.  After a small learning curve, if you are going from Work to WordPerfect, then WordPerfect is actually easier to use.  First, WordPerfect, (""WP"") is more intuitive than Word. Second, WP has better features, such a better dictionary and grammar and thesaurus capabilities.  Third, WP does not clog up your screen space on small devices with a ribbon user interface of things you don't want to do and don't need to do but allows you to create a smaller, customized ribbon of shortcuts to things you actually use.

II.  The PDF editor function is a great feature as you can use it to not merely create but also edit PDF documents from third parties.  This is not only convenient, it allows you to forego buying a separate Adobe Acrobat program.

III.  The eBook Publisher function is so easy to use it is incredible!  You basically just select ""eBook Publisher"" from the menu, go to ""Create"" and it pretty much creates the book for you, step by step, except for that tricky part where you write the book itself.  This is especially useful if you want to create a MOBI eBook for Amazon Kindle.

Finally, the entire program, i.e., WordPerfect Standard Office X8, is a great value because you can download it to three computers.  The only catch is that only one of the three computers is supposed to be using the program at a time.  (I haven't tested this limitation.  Nor do I suggest anyone else tempt fate.  I don't think any of the computers, or the program, would crash.  Using the program on one computer might simply lock it up while in use so that the other computers cannot access the program.  [I'm not a techie, so don't laugh if this is unrealistic.] Or you just might get a gentle inquiry from Corel on when they will receive your payment for your purchase of another Office X8 program.)","Great for eBooks, PDF use, and word processing!",False,1466812800,1.0986122886681098,1.0

- Hatsune Miku V3 Soft has a softer and more gentle tone than original, but still retains much power and clarity.
- Hatsune Miku V3 Dark has a more mature voice and a deep vocal tone almost like an opera singer.
- Hatsune Miku V3 Sweet has a really cute child like voice with a soft tone similar to Kaito V3 Whisper.
- Hatsune Miku V3 Solid has a powerful piercing vocal range easily able to drive strong through rock and alternative songs.
- Hatsune Miku V3 English has a tone similar to Miku original, but a more mature sound to her voice. She can sing English rather clearly considering she still has the cute character voice tone.

"I upgraded from Windows 8 due to being deeply dissatisfied with the Calculator app. You could no longer have it open and usable while working in another program. Instead, the Calculator always ran full screen, with gigantic buttons not particularly useful for a non-touch monitor. Maybe there was a way to get it to run as a sidekick to another program that was full screen, but my computer techs didn't know how, and I certainly didn't either. So I upgraded, and Windows 10 seems OK except for the sales pitches. It sounds a tinkly unmusical phrase and then pushes out a slip of text, lower right, telling me to take advantage of the latest iteration of Office. I really dislike Word and would never use it except under duress, and I really hate my own computer trying to sell me stuff I don't want.

"Win 7 Home Premium was installed on my Toshiba Satellite when I bought it.
What they failed to tell me is that you can not stop Microsoft auto-updates from running.
So without any warning the PC will shutdown and reboot.  As it's rebooting there is a notice that an update is being pushed through.
This means I lose time waiting for the reboot and lose anything that was not saved prior to the update!

This is insane. No other systems shut me down without permission or warning.

Why can't Microsoft allow a short warning to allow me to save my work or bookmark my site?  It's so frustrating after spending time identifying a good site to just watch my screen go black.

Home premium has no off switch for this and no delay feature (it's only on Professional).
As a teacher I can't afford to drop another $170 for another operating system when I just bought this one.

I feel that Toshiba and Microsoft has hidden this issue pretty well.

All the reviews on Amazon are just for Windows 7 and do not address issues with Home Premium.

I guess Microsoft figures the only people using Home Premium are housewives surfing for recipes and whatever work they are doing is of no consequence.  I wanted to be a PC but Microsoft treats me like dirt.

"I'm pretty floored that National Geographic would put their name on a product of such poor quality.  I have struggled to get this software to work reliably under both Windows XP and MacOS X.  While it does launch sometimes, it frequently crashes.  It is slow and full of bugs.  Map quality is ok.  There are much better products out there.  If you're a Mac user, check out MacGPS Pro.  Night and day difference in terms of application and map quality.

What really blows me away, though, is National Geographic's unwillingness to help paying customers.  Calls to the mapping software division simply go into a voicemail black hole.  It doesn't matter if you select customer service or tech support.  No one ever answers and calls are never returned.  If you're lucky enough to get an email response, you'll wait days, maybe weeks and then it's usually just a boilerplate support message with no real help.  Today, out of sheer frustration, I called the National Geographic Magazine customer service department and spoke with a very nice representative who informed me that he has received multiple calls from frustrated TOPO customers like me and that calls are never returned by the mapping division.  He told me that he himself has tried calling them numerous times and has never received a call back, much less had a person answer the phone.  He told me that there was, essentially, nothing I can do, that the mapping division is known for being indifferent to customer issues, and that I would simply have to wait for an email response if they felt like responding.  Wow.  He then he gave me the main National Geographic Society number in DC to call.  So I called them and explained my situation to the receptionist.  She hung up the phone.

Furthermore, National Geographic's support site is woefully out of date.  The MapXchange service is supposed to update your TOPO maps.  Despite being referenced repeatedly throughout support documents and FAQs, the service is no longer offered.  Instead, National Geographic says that by signing up for AllTrails.com one can receive TOPO updates.  So I did that.  But there are no updates.  It's a joke.

BUYER BEWARE: If you buy any software with the National Geographic name on it, you will receive software that does NOT work reliably, and you will receive NO support and NO assistance from the manufacturer.

"In the desktop products, if you are e-filing a state return, there is a $19.99 fee to efile a state return (except free for NY).

If you choose to pay the $19.99 fee out of your Federal refund, then there is an additional $34.99 service fee (for non-California filers) or $39.99 for California filers (In California the optional refund processing service is bundled with Audit Defense and called ""Premium Service"" for $39.99)

If you pay the $19.99 e-file fee upfront with credit card or debit card, however, there is no service fee.

If you want to remove the Premium Service and it's service fee, you need to go through the FILE section again, and remove the refund processing and premium service option, and then choose to pay the TT fees upfront with a credit card or debit card.

I spent almost an hour on the phone to try to get the $40 service charge taken away. TurboTax / Intuit attempted to claim that that the charge was mandatory for the state of California, and that the only way out was if I opted to print and mail the CA Taxes. This was a lie.

The way out is to pay by credit card instead of out of your refund - you avoid the $39.99 service charge and it only charges you $19.99 to e-file the State return.

"The nice people at Cyberlink sure have it made, you know that? They have us as a captive audience for taking care of our BluRay playback needs, and they do a pretty much bang-up job at it when you analyze this software for content, but they do NOT make it easy on the user when it comes to updating things to the current version, ""Mark II"" with a long post title ""10.1.68.xx. xx. xx"" and on and on and on. First off you have to figure out that there IS an update for the software, and that takes some figuring, trust me it does!

There is so much confusion surrounding what and how to update this software, so many versions of their Cyberlink ""Power DVD"" suite that you really have to have your senses about you when querying the software OR their web site proper on doing an update for this software, Hell's Bells, for any of their software for that matter. I am no neophyte when it comes to updating software but it really is difficult to go about the update process with ANY PowerDVD update, any version, you name it, it's confusing!

There are ""OEM"" versions, there are ""bundled"" versions, there are multiple versions of every single thing that these people make and that is just the start of it, because once you install their software it becomes impossible to figure out which version you actually have, so that is the 1st difficulty. And then/IF you have figured out what version you actually have installed there is a series of hoops that you have to jump through to get to the ""Update"" pages and correctly identify the version that you need to update to...THAT is what I am alluding to in my title of this ""review"" of PowerDVD10 Ultra, which is now called ""PowerDVD 10 Ultra Mark II"" with a 3D thrown in there for good measure, with a long postscript and numerical sequence that follows, depending on what you update it to, that is!

It becomes doubly difficult to navigate on their web site when you figure in that you can become a member of their ""elite clubs"" in various capacities, which involves checking in, signing in, and then that changes the update process that you are going to go through further...so go figure what path you should take I guess, that's the question?! Are you beginning to get my contention in full, because I don't want to confuse anybody about the software as it does work fantastic once you get it installed and updated to the latest version, at least in principle it does, but paleeze Cyberlink, couldn't you make it easier to update, identify the version, and figure out which path you need to be taking when you buy a Retail Copy of the software from Amazon.com!?

I wish it was easy to do any of the above, but it's not, unless you are a telepath, and/or have an inside line to the correct version ""updater"" that you should be using for PowerDVD 10 Ultra ""Mark II"", but it isn't or I wouldn't be writing this confusing review about it, which is really meant to clarify the situation and I am probably doing a lousy job at communicating my frustration with the Cyberlink web site, updating process, and navigation there in general...because it IS miserable at best!

As to the software itself, it seems to work great! I have played ""Avatar"" in BluRay on my PC's screen via my LG Super Multi-Blue HG-GW20L internal BluRay burner/reader/writer without any big difficulty, and I've used PowerDVD 10 Ultra ""Mark II"" software to navigate through the extensive menus on the DVD itself to good measure, digging out the hidden treasures there in terms of content on the BluRay disc, which is danged fantastic once you get going on it and are able to enjoy the BluRay for what it is...which is the best content available in any medium for movies, bar none. I also watched ""Step into Liquid"" which is a surfing BluRay adventure, and it was spectacular, so the software *does work*!

I don't have any problem recommending this package for content and features, because it's darned great at that, it's just the Cyberlink web site, the updating process itself, ie the confusing nature of that process that is soooooo unnecessary that you wonder why in the world they do things the way that they do!? I haven't tried out the ""3D"" feature of this software yet although I intend to do just that soon, and maybe I'll come back here and re-do my review after that is done, who knows?

Two other things about this software that also bothers the heck out of me:

1) It's EXPENSIVE beyond compare at about $100 a copy for the retail version with box and DVD installer

2) There is no alternative, save for Roxio's software and we all know what a nightmare that stuff is!

I guess you could say that I'm a tolerant user of this software, and I have it because there is no other choice, that is probably accurate as all get-out when I self-analyze my purchase and use of Cyberlink's PowerDVD 10 Ultra ""Mark II"" 3D. I wish they had some competition to make the playing field level, but they don't and we're all in the same boat so I can only begrudge my purchase, say it's tainted and somewhat difficult to justify , but then again what else is there? NOTHING, that is what!

Find a hole and fill it, that's what this stuff is, unfortunately, and we all need BluRay playback software if we have a BluRay burner/reader/writer and a good LCD display in our computers, or notebooks... Believe me I am using this software in my high-end Asus G51JX-A1 notebook also, why not? There's nothing else to choose from, so I spread this software around my studio, in my notebook, it's in my PC desktop, it's everywhere I use BluRay content, UNFORTUNATELY!

If there was a word or two I could use to describe the necessity and purchase of Cyberlink's PowerDVD 10 Ultra ""Mark II"" 3D BluRay playback software it's this phrase: ""I bought it because I had to, there was nothing else to consider.""

  This is so much better than the other sources that we could not believe the price.  It has a DVD for computer installation, which also contains a number of movies so that one can get immersed in the language.

  It comes with 3 additional CDs for improving pronunciation.  Each word can be heard, imitated and recorded on the computer with instant feedback as to how one's pronunciation is coming.  Not only is one able to hear pronunciation for sounds and words, but also for the vowels, one can see a moving animation of how the tongue and lips are shaped to make the sounds.

  There are lessons set by the program or one can build her/his own lessons based on need.  A pre-test tells one where he/she needs to start.  There is a Spanish-English /English-Spanish dictionary with all of the Spanish words pronounced with the simple click of the mouse.

  In addition to the 144 page quick reference guide book which comes with the program, there is a 170 page workbook in PDF format with exercises and answers. The workbook is excellent and gives the conjugation of a number of verbs.  There are 40 interactive scenarios in which you speak to the person on the screen in an appropriate conversational way.  The computer picks up your voice and the program gives you immediate feedback.

  Even the games, which are fun, stress pronunciation and record your voice to see if you are saying the words and phrases properly.  (I paid over $100 for a voice recognition program which types.)  This program has a cute little gauge which registers how close you are getting to the proper pronunciation.  It goes from tourist to native.  Of course it has sound that that lets you know how well you are doing in addition to the gauge.

  I could go on but . . . Why?  Well, I will just a little.  The words are listed in such a way that they are related.  You can click on a button and have a drill in which a list of words is said in Spanish with the English meaning on the screen.  You can if you wish, repeat and record to get immediate feedback for accuracy.

  You can download to an MP3 or play the CDs when not at your computer. There is even an internet connection from the site which links you to travel information and time, weather conditions in various countries etc.

  No, I do not work for the company but as an educator myself, I think every subject should have a program similar to this, then the USA would rank in the top five in education again.  This is so much fun that kids could learn without pain and the reward would not only be in high scores earned on the computer but good grades in school as well.  With the added benefit of usable knowledge.

  This is the best $17.95 we have ever spent.  Language courses in high school and college did not make language come alive like this.

"Today I had my first experience with Windows 8. My uncle purchased a brand new Windows 8 laptop, pretty good quality, a good processor and lots of RAM. Well beyond the minimum specs to run the OS. Here's a rundown of what happened.

1. It runs like crap. Despite the fact that it was a brand new system with solid specs, and barely any software installed or running, the laptop choked and limped along just trying to browse through the files on an external device.

2. The interface is nonsense. Rest in pieces, familiar, logical Windows interface. I couldn't find anything easily or intuitively. Let's put it like this, I'm 21 years old, I grew up with a keyboard under one hand in a mouse under the other, I've used PCs, Macs, Amigas, and Linux machines. I can logic my way around a new program/OS very easily. I couldn't figure out what the heck I was supposed to be doing. I couldn't find anything. I was completely and utterly lost and frustrated.

3. To some extent, this kind of GUI ISN'T MEANT to be used on a computer. It's designed for tablet/phone use, not a laptop or a desktop computer. Microsoft, why would you do this? If you want a tablet/phone OS, sure, develop one. But it feels ridiculous holding my cursor at the edge of the home screen and waiting for the menu to, with great uncertainty, jerk around for a moment and slooooowly scroll to the left or right, an action OBVIOUSLY meant to be performed by swiping my finger across a touch screen. Why, Microsoft? Why can't my computer be a computer?

4. It's glitchy, picky and unintuitive. It just kind of does things, and sometimes, when it doesn't want to do something, it just plain stops without explanation. All I was trying to do was copy some files off an external drive. It kept dumping folders, eating files, randomly switching back to the home screen, and eventually I discovered, after I FINALLY got it to copy all the files correctly, that it had corrupted the first file in each folder. I didn't know what to tell my poor uncle. I still can't figure out what was wrong.

5. It's missing a lot of function, from what I can tell. I couldn't get it to do basic things like use the arrow keys or even page up and page down to scroll. There was a point at which I literally could not delete a file-- it didn't delete when I dragged it to recycle bin, I couldn't use the delete key, there was no delete function in the right-click menu. It was like being in one of those dreams where nothing quite works how it should and you can't walk straight or open doors. Tragically, it was not a dream.

This is a rant-review brought on after spending approximately 45 minutes with this OS today. The thought of having to use this thing on a daily basis is stomach-turning; I'm incredibly lucky to have bought my laptop before Windows 8 took over. Needless to say, I won't ever be using Windows 8 on a machine of my own. Save yourself the trouble, get Windows 7, or literally anything else.

"I have Magix Movie Edit Pro 17 and PowerDirector 10, so I will make some comparisons.  Powerdirector is obviously designed to make things easy.  In the process it sacrifices a lot of flexibility.  I am interested in 3D so I looked mainly at the 3D features.  Various other reviewers have commented that it can edit Fuji 3D AVI files which contain interleaved L & R images.  But when I tried to load a 3D AVI, it did not recognize it.  This seems to be a mysterious problem unique to my computer and may not bother others.  I found that PD10 allows the video to be loaded, but it does not recognize it as a 3D video.  Magix by contrast loaded virtually any video I threw at it with correct decoding.

It has crashed several times in the first 2 days I tried it.  But Magix is also known to crash frequently, and I have had other video programs also be unstable.

It does seem to to support MP4 interleaved 3D just fine while Magix did not.  But it does not have any way to decode over/under vertically squashed 3D, or 2X horizontally squashed side by side 3D.  Curiously it allows the user to output 2X horizontally compressed 3D.  When 3D is enabled you can not output an AVI which means that it can not output a Fuji compatible 3D avi.

There is no option to output 3D to an active monitor, but it does support passive monitors and anaglyph.  If you view a 3D picture or video on an FPR passive monitor PD does not properly sync the output with the physical lines.  If you move the viewing window up or down one scan line the L and R images are reversed.  This swaps the image from true stereo to pseudoscopic stereo.  Pseudoscopic 3D images reverses the depth of the background and foregroud which makes them look strange, sort of like an indented bass relief.

The printed manual lacks an index which makes it fairly useless.  Again Magix has an index.  Ok, so there is a pdf of the manual, but when I searched on codec I came up with nothing.  Also why do the manufacturers have to be cagy about which codecs are supported?  PD does not seem to recognize installed codecs for output, but does recognize them for input.  So it is possible to input a file in a lossless compressed format such as Huffy, but not possible to output it in the same format.  Indeed the manufacturers also do not give much in the way of details about what has been fixed and what features are actually available.  So when you try to load a file when the codec is missing PD tells you to get another file, rather than helping you by suggesting there is a missing codec and directing you to where you might find it.

WARNING: The 64 bit version is automatically installed on 64 bit systems and you do not have the option of installing the 32bit version.  This means you may have get new codecs for various video files you already have.  During this transitional period it would be best if you could select both versions.  That way you can use the speed of 64bit or the existing codecs for the 32bit.

After some more work with PD 10, I found that it had a problem with producing good resolution DVDs.  If you select HD it maintains the 720x480 NTSC resolution, but Standard or LP cut it to 352x480.  In HD mode you can only burn up to 1 hour on a standard DVD.  The newer version PD 11 fixes this problem by having a separate check box to tailor the bitrate to the disc size so PD can burn good resolution 2hr discs just like the professional discs.  Also the old version ignores the current resolution and bitrate of your source even if it is MPGII, and always re-encodes the video.  The new version seems to directly copy MPG videos which makes PD faster and preserves the full resolution of the original.  Of course it won't do this if you have filtered the video in any fashion.  This is a feature which has long been available on the Magix product so they are catching up with version 11.  But Magix does not have the closed captioning subtitle feature which is available in PD.

In all fairness Magix is trying to attract the semi-pro with their product while PD is aiming it squarely at the average consumer.  But overall Magix has much better 3D support and PD should have supported the Fuji format because it is a major format from the only decent 3D consumer digital camera.  So far their support dept. can not figure out why my computer has problems with 3D input.  Most 3D cameras have the lenses too close together or output anaglyph which makes them toys rather than real 3D cameras.  Also part of the problem is that PD has gone to 64bit while a lot of the existing codecs are only 32bit.","Fast, Easy, limited with bugs in 3D",False,1348617600,0.0,0.0

Instead, you are left with missing media files that you must now manually re-link, missing data etc. I have spent more time doing repair and data entry than I care to count.

"Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac was purchased as an upgrade. I work as an editor and publisher of niche publications and it is necessary for me to have recent versions of software to serve my clients.

That said, this is the slowest, most memory-sucking MS Office yet. The performance on a G5 2.0 Dual GHz Mac running Mac OS 10.5.5 is abysmal. On my Intel Mac Dual Core 2.0 GHz MacBook Pro, the performance is only slightly better.

I suspect the primary reason for the slow boot-up time is that (as a publishing professional) each machine has more than 100 fonts open at any given time. MS Word does not handle large font libraries very well.

My recommendation is to avoid this program if you can. The Text Editor that is part of Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard) is far more nimble and allows documents to be saved as any number of MS Word version documents. It is a better bet for casual Mac users.

PowerPoint is only useful to view PowerPoint documents. I seldom need this function. I do not use MS Messaging or Ms Entourage (Mac Mail is better integrated with my iPhone).

"Office 2001 is a great product. You can do anything with Office 2001 that you can do with v. X, just on the much more elegant Classic Mac OS. In fact, the Office 2004 interface that everyone loves is based on this version, just with an Aqua appearance update and some subtle refinements.

Office 2001 may be somewhat annoying as regards the Office Assistant, but Office 98 featured it too and it wasn't compatible with G4 Macs with 9.1 and later from the factory, of which I'm using it on a Quicksilver Power Mac G4 as the Office version for 9, where it's the only Office version that will work.

I do love Office 2001, but then again that's because Office 2008 made Excel unusable-and I'm not just talking about Visual Basic for Applications, I'm talking about the default half-toolbar, half-ribbon UI that Microsoft pasted onto Excel 2008.

If I am going to use a ribbon, I will use a Windows 7 PC with a ribbon-bearing version of Office. If I want traditional toolbars, I want traditional toolbars-and both Office 2001 for Mac OS 9.1 and Office 2004 for Mac OS X 10.3.9 (both loaded on the same computer) provide that. That's really nice, at least compared to forced Office 2011 ribbon and activation hassles.

"Finally, there is another Zoombinis game.  It took about five years, but I was so excited that I immediately rushed out and bought it.  I was a little disappointed to see that the graphics had changed, so that all of the Zoombinis looked different.  As soon as I started to play it, however, I changed my mind.  Though it only has nine puzzles and three difficulty levels for each, the game is still challenging.  The Zoombinis are living in Zoombiniville happily, until a storm makes some Zoombinis get trapped in a cave.  They venture out to rescue the others, and find that the friendly Boolies have lost their mayor.  Now, the Zoombinis decide to help the Boolies get back to Booliewood so that their mayor will return.  Instead of the difficulty level rising for an entire leg, each level can now have its own setting.  Once a group of 16 Zoombinis gets through a level any three times without losing any Zoombinis, the difficulty level rises.  Math and logic are slyly disguised and placed in each level, without using numbers.  Some of the new concepts include dimension labeling and binary addition.

With how expensive greeting cards are these days, it normally pays for its self very quickly plus allows you to really make it personal to the person receiving the card--plus you get to make flyers, banners, etc for free.

No brand seems to ever really stack up against the PrintMaster package. The quality of the software, clip art, fonts, etc are the best you will find. I have used 5-6 versions of PrintMaster and loved them all UNTIL this ""upgrade"". I am not sure if they sold themselves to another company or just fired everyone responsible for making the good parts of the software but this has been redesigned from the ground up to be just plain crappy. It is slow, buggy, hard to use and full of disappointment. Honestly I wish I could find something I like better than PrintMaster Platinum 18 but there is nothing better and a LOT that is much, much worse.

Comparing the two products, this PrintMaster Platinum 2.0 has an average review rating of about 1.5 stars and this is with a ton of Vine reviews--where Amazon & the software company provides free software in exchange for reviews. The Vine reviews tend to be more positive since the person didn't pay anything for the product and because the reviewer feels guilty leaving poor reviews since they were asked by the company to do them. In this case, 7 out of the 9 four star reviews were from vine users and 8 out of the 9 three star reviews were from vine users as well. Removing those ""purchased"" ratings, the overall user rating would easily drop to 1 star--the lowest possible rating on Amazon.

Whereas, PrintMaster Platinum 18 is currently ranked at 3.5 stars by customers. It is faster, has better templates, better clip art and is better in every way. It is currently even cheaper than this version, but it has been discontinued so you need to grab it before it disappears leaving you with this crappy program as your only option.

"UPDATE 1/24/09:

I am still very satisfied with this product.  So far I've entered all my data, and it's been pretty painless, both for Fed & State taxes.

I have to qualify this by saying that my taxes are pretty simple this year, with no AMT, no sch C, no sch K, etc.  So I'm not really running into some areas that are often not handled well in tax software.

One thing I liked better than turbo tax was the simpler handling of tax-exempt income, splitting the in-state vs. out-of-state portions.  Also, similarly, the handling of US Treasury interest (tax-exempt for state tax).  Turbo Tax makes you enter separate 1099s for each part, instead of just capturing the information within one form dialog.

On the other side, I have some additional critiques:
(1) no ability to import/download W2 & 1099 data (not that I found, anyway)
(2) form 1116 has to be filled out manually, even if it's pretty straightforward -- they could have and should have provided an interview for this
(3) no way provided to simply delete a line in a form (minor point, turbo tax has this, and I find it very useful) -- you can of course delete the data in the line

INITIAL REPORT:

Obviously, it's a bit too early to provide a thorough review of the program, because it's essentially incomplete (as is TurboTax): many tax forms are still not available in their final form.  There will be a Dec 11 update, and I expect several others over the next couple of months.  (I've learned from past experience not to submit final returns until late March, since the bug fixes and form corrections are often not final until then.  This is true for either TurboTax or TaxCut.)

However, here's my current take: this is a fine program, and certainly more than adequate for the necessary help preparing a tax return.  I've used TaxCut in the past, but have used TurboTax for the past few years.  I decided to use TaxCut this year because of the price difference, and because the new licensing policy for TT is annoying.  So far I'm finding it easy to use, and trouble-free in importing data from the previous year TurboTax file and current year TXF files.

One minor weakness compared to TurboTax: I remember that in the 07 TT you could remove a specific set of imported data; I haven't found anything like that in this program.  Not a biggie for me, since I always save ""checkpoints"" in separate files so I can revert to a previous version if I need to, but it's the kind of little thing that makes TT a bit better in my opinion. Just not sufficiently better that I will pay anything Intuit wants to charge (just a matter of principle for me).

Some general comments, based on experience over many years of doing my own (often very complicated) returns:  Neither program is perfect by any means.  For many complicated situations you have to do your own calculations externally (I use Excel), or enter data manually.  Be aware that dealing with AMT, AMT credits, and stuff like that remains mind-bendingly difficult, just not as nightmarish as doing them without a program to help.  And you should always sanity check your results, because odd calculation bugs can persist for a long time.  (I found a very stupid, but hard to find, calculation bug in TurboTax a few years ago, having to do with AMT.)

I will post an update in a few weeks when I've had the chance to make more progress with my return.  Will be able to review the state program as well at that point, perhaps.","good tax program, meets the needs so far",True,1228608000,4.59511985013459,1.0

My purpose for using this software is primarily to create slide shows of JPEG images that are self-running on CD-Rom.  Creating music CDs is secondary to me at this point.  Before I purchased the software, I read a good number of the reviews posted here, so I was forewarned.
Well, the other reviewers weren't lying.  I had a lot of difficulty trying to get my images burned on a CD and then to create a slide show with Photo Relay.  My PC crashed 3 times in the process. There were not any step-by-step instructions on how create the photo album and slide show in the documentation.  I was referred to the Roxio website - which kept freezing up on me. There also did not seem to be a way to specify that I wanted to create the album/slide show on the CD rather than on one of my hard drives.
In the end, I was able to jury-rig a way to do what I wanted by using DirectCD (included in the software). Once I treated my CD burner as another drive, I was able to transfer the files and create the album/slide show.
I tested the resulting CD on my office computer to see if the slide show would run on its own and it worked fine.
I am now trying to figure out how to do this the ""correct"" way using PhotoRelay without Direct CD.

On Macintosh, you can easily create disk images (.dmg files)

out of the CDs using the ""Disk Utility"" program found in the ""Utilities""

folder inside the ""Applications"" folder. Using disk images, the game

will run entirely off the computer hard disk.

Below are the steps to create a disk image on Macintosh. Note that if

you need help with this procedure, we can assist you over the phone.

1. Insert the game CD in your Macintosh.

A CD icon appears on your Desktop.

2. Double-click on the ""Disk Utility"" icon found inside the ""Utilities""

folder under ""Applications"".

The Disk Utility window appears on the screen.

3. Click on ""Session 1"" item on the left-side pane.

The Session 1 of the game CD is highlighted.

4. Click on the ""New Image"" icon in the toolbar at the top of the

application window.

A dialogue window appears on the screen.

5. Set the ""Image Format"" to ""Read only"" for optimal performance and

save the image on your Desktop or any convenient location of your choosing.

The Disk Utility program writes the .dmg file. When the process is

complete, you can close the Disk Utility program. If the process fails,

then it probably means that your copy of the disk is not fully readable.

"My parent is a long time ACT! 2000 user, the upgrade to the ACT! 2009 Premium Edition seems to be a nightmare, in terms of program startup/running speed and stability.

Let me give you cuple example after just a few minutes of using and testing.

He have about 3000 contacts and thousands of groups in his old ACT! 2000 program database, and couple thousand to-do lists.

After conversion of the old 2000 database to the new 2009, the database size has increased about 10 times from 15MB to about 60MB with no new contents added.

The program with the Microsoft SQL express server is running hell slow on a Duo Core 2.0 GHZ machine with 2 GB of memory.

Changing a layout of the program (back and forth from only 2 option available, whcih is 800x600 or 1024x768, none is optimized for today's widescreen LCD monitors.) takes about 5 minutes.  During the layout change, the program simply would just freeze untill 5 minutes later the layout change is finished.

Starting the ACT! 2009 Premium Edition takes at least 1 min and 30 seconds for it to load only 3000 contacts and 3000 to-dos.  The original ACT! 2000? it takes it 0.5 seconds.  Wow, what a difference.  I don't understand how could they make a great program so S***ty garbage in just 9 years.

Open anything with over 1000 entries (Contacts, Groups, Tasks/To-do) takes over 30 seconds on the initial click, and 5 secons thereafter.

Selecting 2000 entries takes over 1 minutes, and completeing them by clearing them takes about 2-3 minutes......

I could not find the separate CD-ROM page to post a review. But you should not download the product either. It would not run on my Macbook because it is 32 bit and not 64 bit. I was extremely disappointed. I checked online and I realized that I had made a huge mistake. I called Amazon and I told them I was sending the CD-ROM back. I hope they refund my money or Amazon will be losing a customer. I may even go into Small Claims Court to get my money back and also report it to the consumer news reporter on my local network news.

"I upgraded to Parallels 11 recently for the specific purpose of upgrading my 2014 Macbook Pro to Windows 10. However, the Windows 10 upgrade did not work for me.  I was able to upgrade the OS with great difficulty, but the network drivers from Parallels cause an infinite loop of blue screens of death when loading Windows.

I contacted Parallels support about the issue and found them unhelpful, unresponsive, and generally incompetent. First, Parallels doesn't have a listed telephone support number (though I think you can call 425-336-3512). So I had to email them, and wait for them to respond to emails which was typically around 24 hours later. The responses were not helpful, so they scheduled a phone call (hence getting the support number). During the support call, the technical support person knew much less about the issue than myself, and I ended up having to help him fix issues that he caused during the call rather than the other way around.

After the frustrating phone call, I received the following email from Parallels support, stating that they had found a problem but couldn't help me or tell me when a fix would be available. Despite the fact that upgrading to Windows 10 had left my Windows machine unusable, they did not offer additional assistance to help restore Windows 7. I would encourage folks thinking about Parallels with Windows 10 to consider alternatives.

Excerpt from support email:
""I've reviewed the collected logs, and discovered a particular error on the code level that is affecting the functionality of your virtual machine. This error is already known to our Development Team, and they are working on introducing a fix in an upcoming update to Parallels Desktop.

I started using Finale 14 years ago to reduce the hours I was spending hand-penning my scores. Even then Finale was far and away the best music engraving tool, and each year the developers have added significant improvements (such as the ability to make Wave playback files directly from the score).

More recently has been the addition of Garritan Personal Orchestra, giving Finale realistic instrumental playback.

The marriage of these three tools has been indispensable to my work but the heart of it all is Finale's ability to create beautiful engraver-quality scores and the flexibility to make significant changes without starting from scratch.  Today I use Finale to create scores of original compositions and arrangements, and to scan scores for producing audio practice tracks for CYC singers.

1. It's clunky. In particular it's really hard to get a handle on what is going on because the spreadsheets feed data to each other, but not in any clear manner.
2. It doesn't cut and paste cleanly with other software. For example I pasted in sections from a word document that included a trademark symbol. This software can't handle it.
3. The software functions are limited and buggy. I tried to do a find and replace to fix the trademark issue. They can find the pasted gibberish that was the trademark symbol, but can't paste their own trademark symbol. Manual correction was the only choice.
4. The online support is pretty limited. Heavy on installation info, although installation went pretty easily.
5. Some of their own tables don't fit the pages correctly. They wrap in a way to make them almost unreadable.
6. They have a task list which could have been a nice idea. However the implementation is such that it misses any additional sections or tables the wizard or the user inserts. Why? This really wouldn't have been that hard to do right.
7. When you delete a default section the task list didn't seem to figure this out either.

the installation & update was pretty painful.

- the installation failed with an error box: ""Invalid commandline syntax (see commandlineImpl::initOptions())""

- updating would not work, failing with the error ""CATax.dll could not be opened""

- tech support suggested that i restart my computer in 'safe mode' to complete the installation...safe mode to install a TAX program?!?!

- it took tech support an hour to fix the install and update, making the installation about an hour and a quarter process (i'll bet that the IRS didn't figure that into their time estimations...)

there's definitely some problems with the form 8801 as others have reported; it did not check the boxes correctly on the 8801 based on 2004 data, even though i had imported it from taxcut 2004.  i had to open the form manually and correct it.

I can't imagine learning the language this way as an absolute beginner. The limited vocab and highly structured repetition would be good for absolute beginners, but the relative lack of explanations, especially about grammar, would drive me crazy if I didn't have a good sense of grammar to start with.

That said, there is a pretty good mix of listening, reading and writing. The ability to record oneself and listen to one's pronunciation is a definite plus.

This is an expensive set of DVDs and I was surprised to find no written materials accompanying it. It is hard to consider this a complete set of language learning materials when there are no written grammatical explanations.

"New Rating: 1 star, update 2010-11-05:
I've lowered my rating of Win7 from recent use- last few months. Two additional items have driven this: 1. Despite having all of the latest drivers, Win7 Pro is unreliable. I've had it lock up at times, every other day, for no apparent reason, and have even referred to logs that didn't indicate a problem. And yes I've verified the hardware with test routines and I have an anitvirus running. 2. Win7 has a baffling interface that is worse than XP, which I didn't consider that good. Menus are spread around with no coherent reasoning. I have two other XP machines and Win7 is harder to use, reminding me of Windows ME. The only machines that have worked reliably-- and there has been some issues-- has been OS X machines (macbook pro, mac mini). After my experience with Win7, I am now looking at adding a dual boot system with Linux, since I'll still need an MS machine for a few programs. I think the basic problem with rating is that if you've only worked with problematic software, you come to expect it, or at least ignore glaring problems. Microsoft continues to make the same kinds of annoying software...

First rating: 3 stars
In the Windows realm, I've used everything from 3, 3.11 Workgroup, 95, 98, XP, Vista and now Win7. Win7 is equivalent to XP with a better gui but more bloat. MS has included the best of Vista while allowing one to tone back Vista's nanny warnings. My PC is setup as an HTPC. It runs pretty well with occasional driver problems but that's a catch-22: lots of vendors (s/w and h/w) making stuff gives you a lot of choices but the cost is occasional program freezes- not a complaint, just reality.

Overall I'm okay with Win7 X64, so why am I only giving it 3 stars? Because this OS makes incremental improvements on XP with a nice GUI that you never enjoy using. A lot of hardware and software is supported, and that along with XP's pending obsolescence are the two biggest reasons to buy it. In fact, all of the current mainstay operating systems could use fresh new replacements to be more intuitive, faster and easier to maintain, but backward compatibility limits, both previous user's familiarity and older program compatibility, limits what's possible.

Overall...
+ Better looking GUI than XP/Vista
+ Better security features than XP
+ Generally responsive
+ X64 bit support is good with a broad range of support for hardware/software
+ Power on and shutdown are faster than Vista, just 12 seconds to turn off.
- Not intuitive. If you do get a problem, google it- don't waste time on Windows help.
- Slow: Cold boots takes 70 seconds to Windows beep prompt, 1:30 until Windows Media Center (set to autoload) ready  w/ a 3GHz E8500 Core2Duo, 4GB & 7200rpm Medium-Fast SpinPoint SATA drive. Of course this would improve a lot with a SSD...
- Windows Media Center occasionally locks up even with all the updates.

The one thing I really like about it is the automatic update feature.  When I run the software, if there are any updates for the program, forms, etc., it automatically asks me if I want to download and install them which I do so I have the most current versions of everything.  Years ago I used to do my taxes manually spending literally hours filling out worksheets to see if I qualified for a particular deduction and how much I could deduct.  Having seen many TV advertisements for TurboTax, I decided to try it.  Boy oh boy, what a difference in the time it took to prepare my taxes.  I don't have a real complicated return, at least I don't think I do, but TurboTax found deductions I wasn't even aware of or that I qualified for.  If you can read, follow directions and answer all the questions honestly, I think TurboTax is the only way to go to get your maximum refund.",TurboTax Deluxe Federal + E-File + State 2012 for PC [Download],True,1358035200,3.7841896339182615,1.0

"Yes, its slow, and they left out VBA support. And it not very stable, either. But the biggest problem I have with the new Office is that MS has once again managed to screw up copy and paste.

I've often used PowerPoint as an archive for graphics, text and equations. I paste stuff into it, and later, when I need it, copy it back out into other documents. I've recently discovered that in Office 2008, things go in, but they don't come back out.

For instance, you can create an equation in MathType and paste it into PowerPoint. It looks fine. But you can't copy it and paste it anywhere else. I was trying to copy it into Adobe Illustrator, but also found that you can't even copy it back into MathType to edit it. Wow.

You can copy text in PowerPoint, but when you paste it into other programs, it loses its formatting. This worked fine in Office 2004.

Besides the copy and paste problems, I've also noticed that some graphics seem to get changed to lower resolution when opened in Office 2008. These are from files created in Office 2004.

The one thing in Office 2008 I do like is the ability to import EPS files and display them. It was about time! But that feature alone is not enough to save this release.","Microsoft screws up copy and paste, again",False,1214092800,1.9459101490553128,0.0
"I definitely think WeatherBug Plus is worth the $$. I have used it for several years, and before moving, ran one of their weather stations.

Also, the previous version is better than the current version. I like the ability to have ""My Stations"", but in the old version, when you clicked on one of ""My Stations"", you got the full details, just like that was your home station setting. Now, you get minimal data, and to get the full information, you have to actually make the other station your Home station. It's doable, but lots of messing around, when they had it so good before.

"I've used TurboTax Home/Business for several years and have always been satisfied with its performance and results. So I was incredibly concerned when I read all the bad reviews, all the problems, glitches, etc., that some customers are having. Whenever I see so many poor reviews, I take notice. So instead I decided to try H&$ Block software for the very first time. It loaded fine, no problems. However, I was amazed that it is nowhere near as intuitive as TurboTax. The import features from Quicken simply did not work (unlike the claims made by H&R), and I would've had to input just about everything manually.  Because I always seem to wait until almost the end to start fiddling with taxes, I simply did not want to go through the frustrations of having to do too many manual steps.

Thus, I held my breath and plunged ahead to order TurboTax Home/Business - taking a risk.  Well, it loaded as easily as it always has been. I was immediately able to import all my data from Quicken and from ItsDeductible site, plus import from other institutions, etc. After I corrected some errors on my part that I had made in Quicken, TurboTax gave me the results of my 1040 to review.  I must honestly say that I am thrilled and relieved.

No doubt some of the consumers who have had problems with it have legitimate gripes, and that can be extremely frustrating.  Intuit has been ramping up their products to be more expensive and less compatible with others every year. QuickBooks is a software that drives me totally nuts - it not only gets more expensive for a small business to handle the price of it, but also the fact that the software really has not improved very much in 20 years.  But that's another story.

I cannot address the complaints about e-file charges in TurboTax. When I got ready to e-file, I read carefully to make sure I would not be charged. I was not charged for the e-filing service.

"I got this mainly for central storage of all my files. More and more I find myself staying in the living room with my family and just using my laptop then going off into the spare bedroom to use my desktop which held all my files. But I do work from both, so getting files between them is a pain.

A simple NAS could have fixed that problem, but while shopping for them I saw some that had some interesting features like being able to access files remotely through a web address. They were extremely limited in this functionality though and lots of people complained that it didn't work well. One company even charges you a yearly fee for this feature. This eventually led me to the HP boxes which worked well and had good reviews, but their price tag scared me. I learned they just ran WHS which I didn't even know existed, so I looked into building my own. This was about the time they announced the WHS 2011 beta so I decided to wait for that to be released so I could have the most current version.

I took an unused computer with a dual core AMD Athlon II processor and 8 GB of RAM, put in a 320 GB hard drive, two 1 TB hard drives, and a 750 GB hard drive.

Installation was effortless and really not much different than installing regular windows. I always build my own computers so I was familiar with the process.

It broke the 320 GB drive up into two drives, one at about 80 GB for the operating system and the other at about 200 GB for storage (the other three drives I connected after installation).

I was able to set up the two 1 TB drives in a mirroring configuration for redundancy by going into the disk manager, you are not able to do this from the main Dashboard application. I just thought I'd share that it is possible if you have a little know how or you can search google for videos showing you how to do it.

Setting up the web access was pretty easy actually and I'm glad to see it runs under an HTTPS connection for free with no certificate errors. Best of all, it can stream your media files. I set the quality to 'best' since I did have a full processor instead of the Intel Atom's the NAS boxes run and the server could transcode video files on the fly just fine. My camcorder uses H.264 in 720p HD which windows normally chokes badly on, but the streaming worked right out of the box with them. The quality is not original quality, far from it, but good enough and will let me easily share with family members without putting them up in places like facebook where who knows when their privacy policies will change.

Client backups are very handy. I have mine setup to do client backups once daily. It will store the last 7 days worth of backups, then the last 4 weekly backups, and the last 6 monthly backups. That means it keeps the last week worth of backups, for older time periods it will dump the older daily and just keep one for the week, then dump the older weekly and keep a monthly. It will do a full initial backup, then it just keeps track of what files have changed between backups, and adds those files the changed to the backup. That means you do not need your backup drive to be several times the size of your client computers.

The backups allow you to roll back a computer to any previous backup. Find out you downloaded a virus 3 months ago? You can roll your computer back to a monthly backup before that. You loose 3 months of changes, but better than loosing everything. Hard drive crashed? You can reload your computer to the previous day and it will be exactly like it was the day before the crash. All your files, all your programs, all your settings, everything.

I only came across two problems so far.

1) It automatically created shares on the 200 GB partition for things like Music, Documents, and Movies. The problem is I already had folders for this on my 1 TB drives that use to be in my desktop computer. There was no way to edit the path for these share folders that were automatically created. You can move them, but not point them to a different directory. The work around is to remove the shares, then recreate them with the existing folders. A bit of a pain, and again this couldn't be done entirely from the main Dashboard application. An alternative would be to move the folder to the drive you want it on, then copy all your files over manually into the new one.

If you are not trying to install drives that already contain data, but are merely going to centralize all your files on the server this won't be an issue for you. Just move the share folder to the drive you want it on, and then transfer all your files over the network.

2) In order to configure a server backup, it needs an entire hard drive, it can not be included with any other files and can not be a smaller partition of a larger drive. I had originally intended to break the 750 GB drive into two chunks. One for client backups, the other for a server OS backup. Unfortunately I can't do that. 750 GB is a bit extreme for the OS backup, which is only about 60 GB... so currently I'm only doing client backups and not doing the server backup. Hope that dosen't come back to bite me. Hopefully in a future service pack they'll add functionality to that feature to be more flexible. The motherboard I have this only only has four SATA ports so it's full. SATA controller cards are rather pricy so I haven't looked into buying one much.

To add to server backups, the default is actually to backup everything on the server, not just the OS. You can configure it though (easily) to only backup specific things. In my case I was going to just back up the WHS 2011 OS, and the client backups (backup of a backup? Sure why not!).

Overall I'm fairly happy with it. I do not have virus software on it because none officially support WHS 2011 yet (some have announced they are working on it). I'm not too worried though, I don't work directly on the server and any files that get transferred to it will first come from the client computers which all have virus scanners. Putting a virus scanner program on it would amount to scanning the files twice, once on the client and once on the server. Redundancy is not a bad thing though.

There are several add-ons you can download for it, for disk management, power management, media libraries, etc. I looked into the power management one called Lights Out, looks cool to suspend the server when not in use to conserve power. It's not free though, so I'm looking into seeing if I can do it manually, I don't need the server on all night when I'm sleeping and don't want to go down to the basement to turn it on/off every day.",Near perfect for the home user,True,1309824000,5.017279836814924,1.0

"I have to say that when I saw the price for the mobile me I thought ""this is terrible"". [...]$ for an email account? How crazy is that? I then signed up for the free trial to try it out. I didn't think I was going to use all of the features, but as it turned out the different things you can do with your mobile me account is actually not bad for the price. You get things all wrapped into one package that you would normally need to use multiple sites, services, and programs for. Can you get all of these things for cheaper from other sources? Sure you can, but then you have to keep track of your flicker, gmail, google calender, accounts separately, and even then you would need to keep all of the software together. Are you paying a price for convenience? Of course you are, but when you look at all the services mobile me replaces and the convenience of having everything in one place (not to mention the built in support for syncing on all macs and ipod / iphone mobile devices) the ""cost"" of the service really isn't all too terrible a price, and when you break down the pricing you are really paying [...] bucks / month for some really great services.

Pros:
1) Having all your email, contacts, pictures, web pages, file sharing, in one place.
2) Having access to all the stuff in #1 on all your mac (and pc) devices
3) VERY simple to use and easy to set up
4) Technical support and help if you have problems (Can you call Google to help you with email problems on your free service? Nope, didn't think so).
5) Easily share your calendars between all your family members at one convenient location using the same software.

Cons:
1) Price Price Price (although it is cheaper if you buy through amazon than auto renewal)
2) Does not sync with exchange or outlook using exchange (although I think this feature will be added soon)

"Sony Vegas is a super tool; I lack sufficient superlatives to adequately describe my fondness for this program.

It's biggest strengths are it's audio capabilities, it's ability to mix resolutions and formats on a project, and it's use of multiple processors for rendering.  It handles multi-camera with ease and presents a very nice UI for cutting between cameras.  The ability to pan around a clip is awesome, and this feature is especially useful when incorporating stills.  The audio and video adjustment tools are great too; in audio you can easily adjust volume or change pitch.  In video you can boost the colors and lighten the ""touch too dark"" shots.  There's a RAM render preview that's just perfect for verifying a transition or checking timing.  The capture tools are awesome!  Each camera take is a separate clip, all done automatically and hands-off!  No mark in/mark out, unless you want to work that way.

I'm torn on the Media Manager.  On the one hand it's super because clips can be tagged and/or commented for easy sorting and grouping.  It has a nifty ""point to it to preview"" feature that makes finding a clip easier.  But it lacks thumbnail previews and a mechanism to see what's already been used in the project, so one ends up going back and forth between file views.

It's biggest drawback is that the Protype Titler is very slow, not intuitive, and generally has a clumsy UI.  Don't use .TIFF files either; if necessary convert them to JPEG in Photoshop and bring in the JPEG's instead.  And the DVD Creator is quite confusing and doesn't multi-thread, so creating a production DVD from a project can take considerable time.

Vegas does require a lot of computer power to run nicely.  We have a 2.4 GHz quad core on which it runs super.  One thing Vegas does well is adapt to lesser machines.  We previously ran on a 1.6 GHz single core and the program down-shifted where it needed to, making reasonable trade-offs.  We were impressed that junior high kids were able to produce a project using Vegas with about 20 minutes guidance.  Of course, there was considerable set-up required first, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend Vegas as one's first editor.  But if you're ready to take off the training wheels and get some real work done, Vegas is an outstanding tool.

I've run other tools and for me, Vegas is by far the best, most powerful, and most flexible.",Vegas Shines,False,1253145600,0.0,1.0

"My 2014 version of Kaspersky has done a good job blocking malicious unrequested downloads from the web.  In a year I have had no problems.  However, I am giving three stars due to their new auto-update system.  When I first installed the 2014 version, I do not recall checking the auto-update box.  I learned years ago from a gym membership not to give anyone permanent access to my bank account.  Today I got an email notice about the auto-update.  I looked at the hidden sender address and it did not look like an authentic Kaspersky address.  I deleted it.  I then had a sinking feeling and did a web search.  Apparently this is the current Kaspersky routine.  They automatically renew an account with the new 2015 version weeks before the previous account expires.  The user loses time paid for on the existing version and gets the new 2015 version that is getting poor reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.  Now I have to decide to either go with the 2015 Kaspersky or talk to my bank to see if I can block the automatic update charge, and then switch to another anti-virus brand.

"WARNING:
Norton 360 2.0 is an awful product.  I have a brand new hp pavilion dv6000 notebook with a windows vista OS.  I had heard some good and bad things about 360 but decided sine it stated vista compatible and I met the min requirements it would be fine.  BE WARNED AND HEED THIS ADVICE:
I purchased the 360 from Amazon.  It arrived fully packaged and sealed and once I installed it my entire system was seized.  Norton 360 was so bad it disabled my internet connection and didn't allow me to access any programs.  When I attempted to uninstall it it froze, furthermore it would not even allow me to go into my control panel.  When I went to my computer settings everything was blank.  After much ado my husband and I were able to acess the windows recovery system (during startup F11).  We backed up to a previous date (Pre installation) and alas the Norton 360 was removed.  However, it did not end there.  My wireless internet connection now ceased to exist.  However it was showing that all of the connections were fine.  After an hour phone call to HP the technician finally disclosed that sometimes Norton elements remain on the system.  Hidden from the naked eye.  He informed me eventhough we did a microsoft system restore as well as a recovery the trace could still be there.  He advised to go onto the Norton website and download the ""Norton Removal Tool"".
Once I sucessfully downloaded the tool and transfered it to my notebook, my system began working again.  Alilejua my internet is back up and all traces of Norton have ceased to exist.

"I purchased the download version of this direct from Garmin, which was explained as being the same thing.  So here's a newsflash for Garmin:  The Balearic Islands - Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza, etc. - ARE PART OF SPAIN and have been since the Greeks and Romans were there.  One of my destinations in Spain was to Mallorca, and guess what my Garmin GPS showed?  I was in the middle of water.  The Mediterranean surrounded me, no land anywhere.  The Garmin was therefore completely useless. Not that the large island was difficult to manage, but it could have saved me a one hour detour and a few other navigational headaches.

On the mainland it worked more or less fine.  Always a good idea to keep a detailed map with you, though, because the GPS directions can be off at times.  Best points:  Generally very helpful in big cities.  E.g., I had a Sixt rental car, and I was instructed to return it to ""Atocha"" in Madrid.  If someone just says ""Atocha,"" it means (1) the large train station on the southeast side of the city or (2) Atocha street, a nearby large road running up the hill of the old part of the city.  The car return location which the German company had designated as ""Atocha"" was a not well marked basement garage with a narrow, forbidding opening beneath a hotel off a very small plaza in an area of winding and twisting streets a long way from anything resembling ""Atocha"".  I had to call the Sixt help line, get the actual address and plug it into the GPS to navigate my way there.  (That's another hint for travelling in Spain:  buy a $20 cell phone with pay by the minute card installed which you can add minutes to at just about every gas station, roadside restaurant or kiosks located all over the large cities.)

This GPS was also helpful while on the road, especially with a Michelin in hand:  Look up out of the way restaurants, then cross check with the GPS's data base of restaurants, then hit ""go"".  It got me to a way cool 18th century farmhouse cum Michelin recommended restaurant in a semi-rural area which no way would I have found otherwise.

 I would have given four stars, but three since the product is misrepresented.  It is NOT complete for all of Spain when it entirely leaves out the very popular and beautiful Balearics.

"A few days ago, I installed Norton Internet Security 2014 (NIS 21.10.0.18) on XP and have had terrible performance problems.  I am running XP SP3 with 1.6 GHz processor and 2Gb of RAM--much more than the published minimum system requirements.

Specifically, my PC slowed to a crawl.  The slowdown was not confined to when NIS was doing scans or updates, but seemed to be more general, making my PC really unusable. Also, after installing NIS, it now takes 30 minutes for XP to shutdown.  Ouch!  The Norton user forum had a thread from another XP user with 1 GB RAM, who was also reported disabling performance problems, and wound up uninstalling NIS.

I disabled Identify Safe with no noticeable improvement.  Spent some time on the Norton user forum, where users pointed out a few other glitches that may pertain to NIS on XP, but couldn't explain the basic slowdown.  Several users suggested that I downgrade to NIS 2012, which they said is much better with performance for older computers, but the Norton chat person told me not to downgrade.

I have done one other thing which seems to have improved performance dramatically: I went into Settings | General | Other Settings and turned off all performance monitoring.  It's still taking 30 minutes for XP to shut down and I still notice some hitches in performance, but disabling the performance monitoring seems to make XP more or less tolerable again at least for the short term.  Forum users would not hazard any comments on whether disabling the performance monitoring would compromise NIS's basic security protection, but when I asked the chat guy about this, he told me ""That is okay that is under performance monitoring. And it will not compromise this computer security protection.""  I hope he's right, because I probably won't have time  to search for new security software for another few days at least, and in the meantime I do need to use my PC.

I might add that the Norton chat guy also said: ""No. You should not downgrade your Norton program. Hence, I suggest that your computer must be the one upgraded.""  Which leaves me wondering why Norton says that XP is supported by NIS 2014, when their solution to performance problems with XP is to suggest I buy a newer PC.

This is my first (and last?) venture into Norton.  I was running Kapsersky Pure 2.0 just fine until the license was due to expire and I only shifted to NIS now after seeing user reviews that Pure 3.0 has install and license verification problems.  I now plan to ditch the NIS as soon as I have time to research a better product for XP.

If you're running XP, save yourself the time and uncertainty, and skip Norton. Keep looking..and let us know what you find!

UPDATE ON JANUARY 3, 2014:
Since writing this review, I continued to have really bad performance problems with NIS 2014 on my old XP computer, even after disabling all the performance monitoring features.  On 12/15/13, I uninstalled NIS in two stages: 1) used the Microsoft Add/Remove software feature from the Control panel 2) after rebooting, used the special NIS removal tool which you can find on the Norton site. I then installed Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 instead. This produced a noticeable improvement in my old computer's performance, back roughly to what it was before the Norton debacle. Yes, it's an old PC and it's running XP so it's not speedy, but at least it's usable again.

I have indeed bought a new PC (that was my plan all along) and installed Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 on that as well. KIS installed easily to my new PC (Windows 8, i7 processor, 8 GB RAM) and is running just fine.

"This is the first game I was able to play with little help from a walkthrough. My family has two computers: I played this game on mine and my 8yo and 12yo played it on theirs. It was fun to be able to help each other when needed.

The game does get a bit creepy in some scenes, but my kids loved the bird. The puzzles weren't too difficult that they couldn't be solved. Jane's games were also fun to play with. The best thing about that is when you got stuck, you could take a break at any time and play a game with Jane (when she was awake and not studying).

It was also interesting how certain scenes were shown on my game that weren't shown on my kids game and vice versa. Sometimes the same scenes we saw on the different games would be shown at different points in the game as well. For example, in my daughter's game she saw both nightmares, whereas I only saw one. She also got scolded by Jane's tutor early in her game, while I got scolded late in the game.

The graphics were slightly better than the older Nancy Drew games and the music was not so ominous. While Nancy's friends weren't there to help, web browsing on the cell phone helps a lot with many of the puzzles.

"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Microsoft 2008...

The Good.  It is now Universal Binary - if you have an Intel Mac, you'll see a major speed improvement - Office 2004 was dog-slow on my Intel Mac (2.4 GHz Intel Core Duo 2 MacBook Pro) due to the need for Rosetta translation.  Initial start-up of all the Office 2008 programs is still very slow - maybe even slower than Office 2004.  Once open and running, the speed difference finally becomes apparent.

The Bad.  Many features went out the window.  If you use Office special features, a lot of them are no longer available.  Some of the features I noticed that were missing include: Visual BASIC, some macro functions, Data Analysts Toolpack (from Excel), and PowerPoint does something to the graphics (I think it changes the format altogether) so you can't do any editing after you enter them into a presentation.

Functionality.  I was hoping that this version would include a lot of the functionality that the Windows version has - Outlook features especially.  I am looking at giving Apple's Mail program another try to see if it is worth using it as well as the integrated Calendar and Address Book applications instead of Entourage.  Pre-Leopard, Apple's Mail program fell short - it is hard to beat Entourage's all-in-one mail, calendar, and address book functions.  I haven't tried the new version of Apple's Mail yet, but I will give it a try in the near future - when I have time to convert all my mail files.  I also noticed Microsoft still hasn't fixed bugs from Office 2004.  One big bug to me is if you copy or cut something, then start Office and try to paste it, you can't - Office doesn't see it.  You have to have Office open before you copy text or graphics in order to paste it into an Office document.

Entourage Files.  One poor design of Entourage is everything is contained in one large Entourage data file.  Apple's Mail program uses many small files - one for each folder and a separate data file for contacts and for calendar events.  That way if a file gets corrupted, you don't lose everything.  Also it is better for back-ups.  With Entourage, the whole file (mine is over 1GB) has to be backed up even though little has changed.  With Apple's Mail program, each folder is a separate file so if you store a lot of old emails, you only need to back up the folders with newer mail - a hundred KB instead of a GB.  Saves a lot of room on your back-up drive.

The Ugly.  I don't like the major interface change.  It is not as intuitive as Office 2004 for Mac or Office 2003 for Windows (Office 2007 for Windows has an interface similar to Office 2008 for Mac).  It is like learning Office menus all over again.

Bottom Line: If you have an Intel-based Mac, it may be worth ""upgrading"" to Office 2008 for the Universal Binary feature.  If you have a PPC Mac, stick with Office 2004.  Sometimes I wonder if Microsoft intentionally holds back the development of the Mac versions in an effort to try to switch people from Macs back to Windows.  The year-old Windows version is superior in many ways to the Mac version.  And Office 2004 is superior in many ways to the newer Office 2008 version.","Universal - Good, Features - Bad, Menus - Ugly...",False,1206921600,2.5649493574615367,0.0

"I had a very frustrating experience last year using the other widely-promoted income tax software program. This year I decided to try H&R Block instead. My initial introduction to the program was a little shaky because it was so different from what I had been using for years; but once I got into the flow, I found myself liking it more and more. I was able to manually enter data drawing from my Quicken software, and everything went in without a hiccup. Where I was not able to file electronically last year (for who knows what reason), this year's filing went straight through. The filing was accepted; and although I have not yet received my refund, that would be the only possible concern still to be faced. If any problems arise with the refund or with the calculations in my filing, I'll add a footnote to this review. As of today, I very happy with H&R Block.

- After reaching a HIGHER UP at Avanquest, I was referred to several techs who had me try different things, yet the issue STILL could not be fixed.

This is a great BASIC Web designer.  However, beware that you may experience the same issues with startup especially running Vista.

I am looking forward to se if the next version is any better.

You will notice on the Avanquest Support Forum that there are MANY users having a problem where after the 1st reboot of their vista machine the software no longer retains your serial number.  You have to enter it each time over and over.

Emails to tach support go unanswered with nothing but reply messages saying someone will get back in a day.  But nothing happens at all.

This product alsmot can be considered abandonware with this type of support.  All I want to do is USE it, and the sewrial number issue continues to happen.. (not only to me .. to many).

"I cannot find a single new feature in this version except the credit score (compared to Quicken 2013).  And not even that works.  I repeatedly entered my correct information and was told it didn't match Quicken's information.  Worse, the auto update repeatedly freezes and I have to use task manager to kill the Quicken thread.  I can only imagine that this will corrupt my data file sooner or later.  Then, when you reopen, everything works ok.  I've also noticed in this version that you can no longer cut-and-paste anything in any register entry field!?  In addition, when you change the amount of a split transaction and it prompts you to adjust splits, if you hit enter, the focus is on the FOLLOWING transaction and it throws an error instead of opening the current transaction to modify the splits.  It's things like this that make me wonder if they test their product whatsoever.

I'm learning to despise Quicken.  I've been using it for over 20 years and it keeps getting buggier.  The testing and quality control is miserably bad.  They never go back and fix existing issues.  Normally, you expect to get at least the same experience you had in the previous version (with the bugs resolved).  But instead, they don't fix old bugs and keep introducing new ones.  Their support organization is also miserable.  It's based in India and the people on the phone typically have no idea what you are talking about.

"After using TurboTax for many years and learning that Intuit decided to gouge us this year, I decided I would try H&R after reading good reviews here. I have stocks to deal with so I picked up Deluxe with state option.

The install and import from TurboTax went well. H&R follows a similar but less intrusive and annoying interview process than TurboTax. They make it easy to get to help and learn relevant information related to the current topic. H&R also has a smoother interface between the actual forms and interview process as well as an easier way to navigate to the various interview processes.

Importing data from employers and brokerage was easy but a bit confusing as they also have last years imported entries as well. I finally get to my first real issue and that was validating my 1099-B's. They have one check box for Box 2 'Type of gain or loss', well box 2 on a 1099-B is actually 2 check boxes, one for Long-term and one for Short-term. Being a software developer I understand that you really don't need 2 check boxes to indicate whether this is a long or short term gain but H&R does not say either way, it's just not possible to know when to check this box.

So I called support on a Saturday morning and after a bit of tag with a computer voice I was quite surprised to be talking to a real person. The surprise quickly ended as the person on the other end had little knowledge of the product and really could not understand the issue at hand. After 20 minutes of somewhat unprofessional support I decided I had enough and would make a guess as to whether item 2 should be checked or not, look at the forms and then determine if checked is long or checked is short.

After figuring out the 1099-B issue I finished up the federal with no other glitches. Now on to state, I was prompted to download my state package, which is Indiana. I live on the border with Kentucky and actually work out of state where Louisville has a local tax that all workers must pay.

All is going well with the state, then we come to some schedules that need dollar amounts calculated. The only thing that H&R does is say to follow the directions to calculate. They provide no direction so I next spend 30 minutes getting specific directions for this calculation by downloading the directions from Indiana's web site. I'm not pleased to have to do this as this is a big reason for buying software.

After moving on I then note that my refund calculated so far looks rather high and after doing some math I determine that H&R has incorrectly summed locality withholdings, it has included the Kentucky portion with my Indiana. It's 10PM on a Tuesday night and the house is quiet so I decided to try the online chat, after 1 hour of, 'we are busy'  and 'we will be with you in a moment' I have someone on the other end. After telling me to try so many things that I knew was just wrong they finally told me how I could override the actual W-2 value that was pulled into the state form. This process took 49 minutes and was the most unprofessional interaction I have ever had with any customer service, I will say that this person should be fired.

I didn't note while on the chat that the software tells you when you override a field that you cannot efile. No big deal it will save me the additional $19 efile charge. I get to the final accuracy check and I am told my W-2 locality entry does not have a state marked and that I need to go back to the federal section under W-2 and fix this. I know the issue is related to the out of state local tax entry but after 30 minutes of trying I am unable to resolve by myself.

This is where I am right now I think I will just cut my losses and do my state by hand, it will probably be quicker and less painful than dealing with the horrible support that H&R has provided.",Lesson Learned....You Get What You Pay For?,True,1426032000,0.0,0.0

"The process started with 4 1/2 hours to install this program.  Next came the email issue--which took hours more to set it up.  It essentially took an entire day to install and set up, occupying the computer and rendering it useless for any other tasks.

My husband is STILL complaining about the damage wreaked on the laptop by this security software. For experienced users, this was way over the top in terms of its invasive nature and slowing of the computer.  It undoubtedly prevents any kind of invasion from the outside world, largely because it nearly severed the connection with the internet because of how it slowed the system down.

It cataloged and re-organized his email too--deeming most of it as ""spam"", regardless of what his original sorting of it really was. It marked every single ""safe"" sender in Outlook as spam, and completely erased all of his gazillion rules managing the email. It also stopped future downloads of email into Outlook until the software was removed from the computer.  It also eliminated all RSS feeds.

It completely prevented working on websites--it regarded everything as ""malicious"" or ""suspicious.""  (For the record, this was a laptop with a dual core processor running Windows 7 Ultimate x64.)

All in all, it lasted a week.  It was a disaster, and two weeks later, he still rants about the havoc.  It was not easy to remove either, leaving traces of itself in many locations, resulting in a lot of ""clean up"" work being required, in addition to the time fixing Outlook.

On the plus side, for inexperienced users who don't work on websites or manage mega-email, it's easy to use and seems to do the job it is intended to without disrupting their surfing, email, and other typical tasks.  It has to be set on moderate or minimum security level in order to work.

We've used McAfee, Norton, Trend, NOD32, AVG,and BitDefender in the past, in addition to Microsoft's Security Essentials.  We have never had any security suite wreak this much havoc or be this much of a problem, on ours or anyone else's computers.

"I've been using this desktop navigation utility ever since it first appeared about 5 or 6 years ago, as a ten-buck shareware application, when the most up-to-date Mac OS was OS 7.6.

What is it? Action GoMac provides a Windows-like ""Start"" button, located precisely where you would expect a Start button to be if you were a Windows user. In this respect, GoMac is ""more than useful"" for Windows users acclimating themselves to the Mac OS for the first time. But it gets better.

GoMac is a Start button on steroids. Like the Windows version, it provides a Start Menu for navigation through folders and files, a QuickLaunch toolbar across the bottom of the screen where files and applications can be launched with single clicks and files can be ""dragged and dropped"" for opening, application buttons showing which applications are currently running, and, on the far right, a Clock Tray (including a pop-up calendar). The application buttons can be toggled either by mouse action or they can be tabbed through. A preference is provided for which only the active application (and its files) is open on the screen; alternately, all open applications and files can appear in separate windows if desired. An ""Auto Hide"" feature can be selected so that the GoMac bar disappears except when the cursor is over it. (Otherwise, one is left with the usual ""Windows clutter."")

The ""steroids"" enter the picture by way of the total flexibility with which the Start Menu and the QuickLaunch features can be programmed and arranged. Virtually anything - application, file, control panel, driver - can be placed in either location, providing unlimited flexibility and personalization. In most respects, the Start Menu is both more flexible and easier to customize than the Apple Menu. Even the appearance and size of the Start button itself can be personalized.

Here are a few good ideas that I've discovered, applying to my own method of operation and, possibly, to yours as well:

I put the TC/ICP control panel on the QuickLaunch toolbar. This way, I don't need to go searching for it in the control panels folder should I need to change my Internet connection (either because I'm travelling or because I've suddenly lost either my cable modem service or my phone service).

I put the ""Add Alias to Apple Menu"" AppleScript icon there as well, giving me ""drag and drop"" ability to quickly add to the Apple Menu. (Anything may be added to the Start menu by simply dropping it on the Start button.)

I put the Finder icon in the Clock Tray, freeing up space for other application buttons.

Now, in 2002, I'm running OS 9.2.2 on a Powerbook G4, which, with its huge 1152 x 768-pixel display, makes GoMac even more useful. Routinely, I'll have more than two dozen icons in the QuickLaunch toolbar and four or more applications open, with that many toggle buttons showing; the extra-large display certainly helps in this respect

Finally, despite the fact that GoMac has been - for about a year or so - a commercial application at a higher-than-shareware price, it is still a bargain, in terms of what it adds to any Mac running in ""Classic"" environment.

Users of Mac OS X have entirely different means for navigation, so my comments will not apply to them. But, if you're not on OS X, this utility is well worth your consideration.

"Abbyy's Home Edition follows the trend of software publishers to milk previous versions of their software, in this case, Abbyy's Finereader 5.0 (the current version for those with lots of money being 6). The OCR engine is solid, and the ""1-button"" interface is uncomplicated.
When it's time to move beyond the 1-button world, the product has a number of beyond-the-basic features, including the ability to manually identify regions of text, tables, and graphics. For much of today's complex and graphic-intensive layouts, you'll find yourself using this mode, if only to avoid annoying glitches such as parts of dense tables showing up as graphics
in the recognized file, or side-by-side columns becoming tables.
Home Edition handles both scanned files (...) and a wide range of graphic files that contain text. Fortunately, although the manual states that Home Edition recognizes only the first page of multi-page graphics files, that's not true -- all the pages of multi-page FAX TIFF files are recognized.
Recognition is good. For scans at normal resolution, 300 dpi, the total number of errors per page for a mix of type from 9 down to 7 points -- pretty small for OCR -- were the same as my old, 1999 Scansoft Textbridge Pro 8.0. However, the Home Edition errors were far easier to fix (""S"" for ""$"" on small, 7-point type for AHE, less annoying to me than the strange concatentions or ""wordifications"" for TP8 (such as ""Pap er"" or ""andPublish""). When the same material is scanned into Home Edition at 600 dpi (to add detail to the very small type), errors dropped to half that of Textbridge, which doesn't accept scans of this resolution.
A very difficult case, a second-generation FAX of a magazine article originally in tabloid and reduced to 8 1/2 x 11, was recognized surprisingly well with Home Edition, despite the fact that the type was fuzzy and 4-6 points in size -- and the bioprocessing subject matter had out-of-the-ordinary words. However, the 1-button process made tables of some of the columns, so manual marking of the original was needed.
I miss the ability to view the original scan during proof-reading in Textbrige (and the Abbyy higher-end products) -- as you move the cursor through the recognized document, these show you the same area of the scanned file. In Home Edition, you have to move between the scan and the recognized windows and find your own place. There's also no built-in spell-checker, an odd omission considering the low cost of licensing spellchecking code these days. Perhaps Abbyy is justifying the gap in pricing between Home Edition (less than[$$]) and the Professional line ([$$-$$] at the Abbyy site store). Versus the Pro Edition, Home Edition has 12 languages (121 for Pro); no pattern training for symbols; and no background or batch mode. There's apparently fewer options with HE's manual layout analysis than for the Pro Edition, but the HE options are just fine for most purposes.
Abbyy HE saves recognized text as ASCII TXT, Word, Excel, Word Pro and Word Perfect files, plus HTML and Adobe PDF. The good OCR engine, the ability to handle multiple types of graphics files, and to preserve graphics color, plus its straight-forward interface all make this a good product.","Gives you a low-cost, high-performance OCR package",False,1039910400,3.3672958299864737,1.0

"I've used PhotoScore along with Sibelius for several years.  It performs better than these one-star reviews claim.  I use it to transpose sheet music and hymns, extract parts from scores and re-arrange choral music.

This is basically OCR software for music.  It needs to recognize and interpret staves, notes, symbols and lyrics.  The poorer the scan, the poorer the results:  GIGO.  It converts modern sheet music almost perfectly.  Older engraved sheets that are yellowed or are already second-generation printings will require some editing.  Smaller notation produces errors, especially in lyrics (think hymnals).  Directly converting PDFs has never worked well for me unless they are unusually high quality.

Converting hand written scores only works if you follow specific guidelines for writing the scores.  If the hand written scores have broken staves, stems or non-standard markings, you'll be out of  luck.

So why do I recommend the software?  Because if you take the time to learn the software and experiment with scanning, you WILL save a lot of time over hand copying or entering notes directly into Sibelius or Finale.

Here are some suggestions for successful conversions:

*Read the manual and understand how the settings affect the output.
*Use a good scanner.  I keep an old HP Scanjet 4470 on my desk for music scanning.  It will produce an actual (not interpolated) 600+ dpi image.
*Adjust the contrast and brightness settings much higher than normal to give a stark edge to the notation and staves.
*Go beyond the dpi settings suggested in the manual.  I've had success using up to 600 dpi resolution on small notation.  The files will be huge and processing will be slower, but accuracy will be improved. Beyond 600 dpi the files are so large that PhotoScore chokes.
*I have much better luck if I print PDF pages and use those copies to scan into PhotoScore.  (When I print the PDF pages, I increase contrast and brightness settings.)  This works particularly well with scores from IMSLP.org (PD website for classical music).
*Correct timing errors in PhotoScore before you send the music to Sibelius.  (The reason will become obvious once you've tried it both ways.)

The software works, but like any high level application you need to invest some time learning how to use it.  It's not ""plug and play"" by any means.

UPDATE:

Recently I needed to transpose a tune from a Broadway vocal/piano score.  The original's print quality wasn't great - stems and staff lines had some breaks.  I tried the usual tricks listed above but was still getting lots of mistakes in the conversion.  The technique that finally worked was this:  Using my laser printer, I copied pages with increased density and REDUCED the size of the pages by 15%.  When I scanned those copies into Photoscore the conversion was almost perfect.  Apparently the reduced size and density closed the gaps enough to trick Photoscore into seeing unbroken lines.  Even with time spent experimenting, it was still faster than transposing the ten page score by hand.

YET ANOTHER UPDATE:

I was transposing hymns again today and had to REDUCE brightness and increase contrast to get a good scan.  You can tell pretty quickly if the scan is going to work or not depending on whether PS recognizes the staff lines after you click ""read"".",Please read this.,False,1369612800,3.8918202981106265,1.0

"Safe Eyes was a fantastic program when I used it on my PC with Vista about 9 months ago.  We recently invested in a Macbook Pro and, after noticing that Safe Eyes was one of the highest rated Parental Control software of Mac, we decided that we would again use this this program.  Right off the bat I was impressed with the beautiful look of the new program and excited to use it.

There are several functional problems and let downs that seem too obvious to have been overlooked and I will try to outline everything I have noticed over the past few months with this program.  I will be exhaustive below but attempt to give a ""final conclusion"" summary at the end of this review.

(1) Usage time.  There is a feature that allows you to ""turn-off"" the internet on your computer at certain times during certain days (ex. you do not want internet access after Midnight).  (A) When using the internet around midnight, only about half of the time will Safe Eyes actually stop what you're doing to say that you're logged on after hours.  (B) If you close your computer before the cut off time, and open it after the cut-off time, you will (about half the time) have internet access for the rest of the night.  (C) Sometimes it will mistake midnight for random times during the day.  There have been many instances where I will be working and suddenly Safe-Eyes will pop up and say ""You have used your allotted time for the day"" only to turn off and turn back on.  Very annoying when uploading files, as you have to stop and restart the process.

(2) Usage reporting.  Safe Eyes allows you to send real-time reports to email or phone when somebody is trying to beat the system.  The reports are in blocks of 2, 5, and 10 blocked sites that the user tried to access in a particular amount of time.  (A) The reports are vague and unhelpful.  Only the base websites are reported and no reason is given for this.  For example, we would receive reports that say ""google . com, yahoo . com, aol . com.""  That is the extent of the information given.  It would have been nice if details like ""searched for term 'porn'"" or ""site includes word 'violence'"" were included, but no such details exist.  Because of this, it is easy for reports to be worthless (unless the website title is overly obvious).  (B) Another flaw is that after a site has been tripped, you will have ""free reign"" on that website without fear of a report being filed.  For example, someone decides to look for questionable content on youtube.  If they haven't been tripped on anything else, they can stay on youtube, tripping it hundreds of times, and no report will be sent (the usage reports only report each website once).  This leaves the possibility of testing the ropes of the software to find out what you can and cannot get away with.

(3) Random shut-downs. Safe Eyes has a feature where you can disable the program for a period of time, making the icon a grey check-box instead of a green check-box.  Every now and then (typically once or twice a week) the program will randomly disable itself, giving un-restricted access to anyone on the computer at this time.  I have noticed this primarily after it falsely attributes the current time for the disabled usage time or first thing in the morning.  This lasts anywhere from 5-30 minutes before the program will restart itself correctly, but any websites open once the program starts up will not trip the filter.  During this time, websites will not be blocked and reports will not be sent.

(4) Not able to customize word-search presets.  The most helpful part of Safe Eyes is the ability to type in words that you don't want yourself or others to be searching for on the internet, causing the filter to trip whenever that words is displayed in the URL line or page title.  You also have the option of clicking a pre-set that blocks all sexually suggestive words.  The problem, however, is that you are not given the opportunity to customize the pre-set words.  The pre-set will over-block to an almost unbearable amount.  Some websites that we can no longer access are Netflix, hotmail (about half the time), many google searches, and many others.  Any URL that uses a (seemingly) random assortment of letters and numbers is at the risk of being blocked (the letter ""X"" is a favorite).  The alternative is to customize your own list and put in as many inappropriate that you can think of without using the pre-set.  The problem with this is that there are always new ways to look for something and it will takes weeks (if not months) of trial and error before having a safe program for whomever is struggling.

(5) Over-block and under-block.  Typically over blocking is safer than under blocking. However, Safe Eyes will block many things it shouldn't and you will find yourself constantly receiving emails for the same sites (ad sites, search engines, etc).  On the flip side, it is incredibly easy to under-block unless you've put in every possible combination of words and letters.  For example, our computer is not able to access Netflix (due to the ""x"" in the word) or hotmail (half the time), but misspell an adult film star's name and you've got a full array of potential websites to visit.  Some may trip, others may not.

(6) Customer Service. Though they have always been nice and upfront with me, they are, for the most part, unhelpful.  For the above five issues, the solutions were:

1) Some sites automatically refresh the page (fox . com, for example) and will keep the Usage Time from kicking in.  Many online games will also have this same effect.
2) They do not support more detailed usage reports at this time
3) They had to install a script onto my Mac to disable the auto-shutdown that occurs when Safe-eyes does not detect a network for 5 minutes.
4) There is no support for this, you just have to use trial and error or say goodbye to some of your websites
5) See #4

Overview:  Overall, I had no complaints for Safe Eyes on Windows, but on Mac it is just too glitchy.  When you combine the errors in time for usage times, the generic and unhelpful reports, the random shut-downs, the inability to customize the presets, the tendency to over block innocent things while under blocking questionable content, and the lack of support from Customer Service, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this program to anybody.  Though it does restrict many things and has proven to be extremely helpful, it has taken about 4 months of trial and error to get to a place where one can safely surf the web.  Unfortunately, it's easy enough to get around still and may be out-of-date in another month or two.

"I normally try to avoid being rude, but this app is ridiculously useless. The only thing I liked is my book covers are bigger on my laptop than my Kindle 10.

It gives you the option to import collections, yet it won't allow you to import collections.

"Having seen the many reviews that said this product would not load if you have Mac OS 10.9 (Mavericks), I went to the Norton web site and found two messages indicating that Norton Antivirus (NAV) 2012 was now compatible with 10.9. So I decided to purchase it. When offered the choice of buying a physical copy or a download, I opted for the download, thinking that Norton would have applied all the updates to the digital version. But, no doing ... when I tried to install the product, I was told that it was incompatible with my OS.

This made me mad, and I then spent two hours (!!) trying to call Norton and finally got help via a Norton live chat agent. Even when I let the remote tech take over my machine, it took him an hour to get the program working. The problem was that the failed install had to be removed, but to do that you had to have the remover program that has to be installed with the program (which, of course, hadn't installed). He then had to get a special removal program (only available to Norton techs) to deal with the failed install, and then get a new install program from Norton 360 Multi-Device 2014.

The bottom line--if you want to be able to use NAV on your OS 10.9 Mac, and don't want to endure hours of tech fiddling from Norton, you have to buy Norton 360 Multi-Device 2014, which costs a whopping $59.99.

My one-star rating is not for the program itself (which worked very well once I had it installed), but for Norton's inability to provide a 10.9-compatible program to anyone but previous users of NAV or those who can afford to buy Norton 360 or those who will spend three hours working with Norton's ""support"" techs.",Beware if you have Mac OS 10.9,True,1392681600,0.0,0.0

"I have been using Norton before trying Trend Micro Internet Security for as long as I can remember, and I'm sorry to say that I think it's going to stay that way.  I don't hate this product at all and it does include many more things that Norton does not.  I just don't feel I need them and it really slows down my computer.  I would compare it to Norton 360. The Norton Live and the anti-virus protection is all I need. Someone who does a lot with finances may find this item well worth while.

There was a little problem for me with the install because it was a different product than the Norton 360.  It kept de-installing itself even when I de-insalled the Norton. I wasn't sure why because I was following the directions.  I chalked it up to not being extremely computer savvy.  But, I noticed that after Googling, I wasn't the only one with this problem. It would stop in the middle of loading and it would also shut down my computer. I've never had that problem with the other product, so I started getting a little nervous.

I've ""played"" with Apple's Dictation feature with decent results, but it's pretty basic.  I'm originally from the midwest, and I've lived on the West Coast for over 35 years, so my accent is fairly ""flat.""  Also, I'm using the Mac's built-in microphone -- no external ""higher quality"" mic for now, as I wanted to see how it would operate using standard equipment.

Installation went about as I expected (I worked in IT before I retired), so no major issues.  I worked through the tutorial, again with no major issues.  Dragon seemed to be able to understand what I was saying most of the time.  It's relatively fast, too -- but I do find I have to slow down my normal speech pattern in order for it to understand.  If I go slowly enough, I can get about 95% accuracy; if I speak ""normally,"" it drops to 80-85%.

I guess the biggest problem I'm having is its tendency to misinterpret words for commands, or not understand commands that it's supposed to be able to handle.

"I've been a quicken user for 13+ years and have been completely satisfied.  I recently purchased both Quicken deluxe 2009 and turbotax deluxe 2008 for $54.98 no tax and no shipping.  You can get that price usually once a year.  Basically, I buy turbotax at the current price and always get Quicken deluxe for ""free.""

I did have issues upgrading from Quicken 2008 to Quicken 2009, but given my current long term experience with Quicken, I always back up my data on a different drive each time I download data.  My Quicken file is now up to 22+ megs.  During my last upgrade, some of my data had not been transferred and who knows why.  This was frustrating and scary, but it has happened before.  I'm running Vista and I ended up totally removing Quicken 2009 and reinstalling Quicken 2008.  I then loaded my latest 2008 backup version and did a validation and super validation to ensure that the data file was not corrupted or had cross-links etc.  The file did not have any issues after I did both validations.  I think I performed a file copy as well, since that has an impact on the data file.  I then reinstalled Quicken 2009 and then quicken ""successfully"" converted my 2008 data file to the 2009 file.  However and for some reason, I had to run Quicken in administrative mode to successfully open my new 2009 data file.

Was it frustrating?  Yes, of course but I still think that Quicken is an outstanding program to integrate all your financial data.  The program has totally automated my financial holdings.  I still will give Quicken 2009 5 stars.  However, I do agree with some of the reviews on the stability and buggyness of the software.

"I spent two hours today in a chat with two HR Block Customer Service Reps.  The issue?  After entering NYS tax info, I noticed that the refund amount was low.  That made my Spidey senses tingle.  My husband works in NYC and therefore pays NYS and NYC taxes.  HR Block didn't ask about the NYC taxes and it didn't transfer the NYC tax amount that was entered in the W-2 section of the Federal return.  I figured that I had made a mistake and went through the NY section several times with no luck.  Then I pulled up the NY form and found the NYC tax box and tried to enter the amount manually.  The program wouldn't let me.  After many tries, I decided to contact customer service.
This is what happened...
Rep 1 told me to restart my computer because that would allow the program to ""kick-in"".  I asked her why the software didn't prompt users to do this if ""kicking-in"" on installation was a problem.  She had no answer and I gave in and restarted the computer.  This, of course, disconnected me from Rep 1 who probably told me to restart to be rid of me.  After restart, the issue wasn't solved so I got back into the Customer Service queue.
Rep 2 told me that there is no separate interview for NYC.  She added that this is because NYC was a city and not a state.  I repeat, she said that NYC didn't have an interview on the NYS return because it was a city and not a state.  After doing a facepalm, I explained to her that some cities collect their own taxes.  As such, since NYC (and Yonkers) are part of NYS, there should be an interview for both NYC and Yonkers on the NY software.  She had me pull up the form page and right click on some boxes which took me to other boxes that had nothing to do with our situation.  While she was searching for a way out, I discovered that I could override the blank in the NYC box.  This caused a warning message to appear that said that an override would not allow for efiling.  Additionally, the software did not recognize this override and although the refund on the form changed, the interview screen amount didn't change.  After a lot of failure, I asked for a refund of the state (I had NY free & NJ paid) and she refunded my money.  Amazon was also nice enough to give me a full refund of the software even though I bought it over a month ago.

I do not understand how HR Block missed NYC and Yonkers.  This could affect millions if they don't realize that money they paid to those cities wasn't recorded.  I've used Turbo Tax for years and only decided to switch to HR because of the stunt Turbo Tax pulled this year.  Our state refund was thousands more last year and there were no issues with NYC on Turbo Tax.  How HR Block could gloss over these two cities is mind boggling.  Oh yeah, it's because these are cities and NY is a state.  Buyer beware...You may save a few bucks with this software but you could be out thousands in unclaimed taxes.  You've been warned.

"I am a retired electrical engineer.  I had a lot of CAD experience at work, but most of that was laying out circuit boards with programs specific for that task.  My primary use for Turbo Cad is designing model airplanes in 2D.  I've been using it for about 6 weeks now.

Pros:
1)  Powerful for the price.  I bought V16 Deluxe for $30 when version 17 was the latest and greatest.  This is orders of magnitude better than anything from Autodesk.

Cons:
1)  Not intuitive.  I'm OK with having to learn how a specific function works, but it is frustrating to completely lose a function you have already learned.  For example, is the Mirror button in the Edit menu, or was it in Modify, or maybe Format?  No, it's in the Copy Entities submenu of the Edit menu!
2)  Toolbars are confusing.  For example, the Draw Line button is usually on the toolbar, but if you have recently drawn a rectangle, the Draw Rectangle button will replace the Draw Line button on the toolbar, and you have to go back to the menu to get the Draw Line button.
3)  Help is terrible.  Help for any topic calls up the same 702 page help screen (the PDF manual), and only rarely takes you to the correct topic.  To add insult to injury, the PDF manual covers all versions of Turbo Cad, so half the manual doesn't apply to Deluxe.
4)  It crashes frequently on my computer (a 2 year old Dell laptop running XP).
5)  Snap to grid (a feature I use a lot) is so awkward it is almost useless.  Example one:  When you move an object, the move handle is not automatically on grid.  You can put it on grid manually, but this is an extra step, and if you forget your grid placement is screwed.  Example two:  The snap capture range changes dynamically depending on the current zoom size.  So if you are zoomed in too far, it won't always snap to grid, and your grid placement is screwed again.
6)  No support for custom paper sizes, and there are no page sizes larger than 36"" x 48"".  So using a big plotter which cuts its own sheets from roll paper is not as useful as it could be.  This is a serious limitation for building model airplanes.","Hard to use, but some serious limitations",True,1292803200,0.0,0.0

"Windows XP (both Home and Professional editions) are absolutely horrific. I say this especially with the introduction of Service Pack 2, which makes the software even worse. First and foremost, Windows XP requires that you have a lot of RAM and video memory, simply to display its overly-graphical interface. This shouldn't be a very big deal, considering that most modern computers are equipped with requirements necessary to run it. However, Windows XP is not suitable for older computers, or computers with any less than 256 MB of RAM, and low video memory. (Though it will technically run, it will be very laggy.)

The software, which is full of security holes and risks, will likely require you to reformat every 30 or so days. (Assuming that you do not have the sufficient virus protection available to block the many viruses developed purely to abuse the security holes found exclusively in Windows XP.) However, to counter this, Microsoft has developed Service Pack 2, which is an utter nightmare. Service Pack 2 adds a built-in firewall (improvement) and virus-blocking feature, which runs in the background at all times. Whenever you attempt to download something, or execute certain files, you will always be faced with the firewall asking for confirmation. This can become rather annoying. The worst part about the service pack is that it attempts to prevent piracy by not allowing you to install certain software. i.e., you will not be allowed to install, or run, Alcohol 120%. (Or other versions.) Any attempt to do so will cause your system to crash, leading you to the 'blue screen of death.' (Something that has no business appearing in Windows XP.)

The detault software settings have the Windows Messenger utility enabled, which means that advertisers will constantly spam you with pop-ups which cannot be blocked. (Unless you know how to turn the feature off, or unless you specify for you firewall to block it from being contacted.) Many people have taken advantage of this by developing patches which turn the feature off, but they charge you to use it. In actuality, anybody can turn it off. It's a simple matter of going through your control panel, into your administrative tools, and disabling the feature there. However, nobody is expected to be computer literate enough to do so.

This time around, Microsoft has decided to bundle spyware with Windows. Though you can remove it with any standard spyware scanner, it is still an annoyance.

Microsoft has also decided to add a 'Product Activation' tool, which forces you to go online and validate your product key with Microsoft. There are a limited number of times in which you may do this, meaning that you can only reformat your computer so many times before your key expires. At this time, you have to pay Microsoft $10 for a new product key.

Lastly, Microsoft has done nothing to improve Internet Explorer, or any of its other built-in software. You are stuck with the same, tabless version of IE, which still has all the same security flaws as before -- if not more.

I would much rather stick with Windows 2000, or Windows NT Workstation 4.0, than Windows XP.",Absolutely Horrific,False,1124496000,3.555348061489413,0.0

I fly fixed wing airplanes and use a futuba 6xa radio with a round trainer plug. I need to purchase an adaptor to hook up the simulator to my radio. They vary in price for different radios. You do have the option of purchasing a radio with the simulator but I wanted to use the radio I would use in the field. Everything pluged up fine and easy. The program install flawlessly and after a simple calibration of my radio to the program I was ready to go. One feature I really like is everytime I open the program it goes online to check for new free download aircraft which you then have the choice of adding to the program or not. The simulation seems very realistic. All the aircraft have different flight characteristics so they handle differently. With the exception of having to add the adaptor cord this is perfect for my use. Highly Recomended,RC Simulator,True,1300924800,2.772588722239781,1.0

""World of Goo"" will not do that to you.  There's just nothing fake about it to leave you feeling disappointed or underwhelmed. It is authentically beautiful in every way. The gameplay is utterly unique. The story is silly and fun and well written and creative. The graphics are expressive, colorful, and buttery smooth on my average computer. The music is hauntingly catchy. The sound effects are perfect. The two independent guys who released this game (their first, according to the press) are far cooler than the conglomerates that just churn out sequel after sequel after sequel these days, changing nothing but the graphics of their tried and true formulas. We need another run-and-shoot game like we need another smallpox epidemic.
""World of Goo"" is just FUN. I stopped playing and now I'm overtired because it's three AM and it's past my bedtime but I couldn't bring myself to turn it off until now. I guess I can't really imagine how the game can go on for weeks like some of the other titles you can buy, but World of Goo is only $20 - that's less than half what most video games cost.

"Caveat:  I am comparing this to systemworks standard, 2005.

Although I've been a user of symantec/norton products for about 10 years now, there has always been some bugginess about them.  This is the smoothest release I've ever seen.  This is also based on a 3 day review, so it's not really thorough.  This also refers to the download version, which is a bit more difficult because I had to burn my own ISO boot/backup/restore disk.

That aside, the reason for the 4 stars is the redundancy in ways to do the same (or very similar) thing twice, and for the minimal (if any) changes to Norton Utilities.  Norton Ghost 10, for example, does automatic and manual restore checkpoints on backups.  GoBack does the same thing, but it's not meant for ISO, obviously. GoBack hasn't changed much, if at all, since 2005.  However, the two togther are somewhat redundant, and could be possibly merged.  Safe install in Goback is now automatic, tho (i.e., ""it appears you are installing a new program, you'll have the option to restore to pre-install conditions"" or some such verbage).

Norton Utilities is about the same, straight up.  Wipe slack space, for example, is still a drop down selection, rather than a button option.  In fact, everything in Norton Utilities seems the same in the control panel from 2005.  No memory defrag. No internet tweaking tools.  Just as an idea, symantec, if you're listening, and have no plans to improve Norton Utilities, you could set up a way to allow plug ins like Nvidias N-Tune app...

What's new to me (and possibly other upgraders) is Checkit, which has been updated (but still covers mostly the same content), and Benchmark test, which compares my system against others, and itself, during tweaking, overclocking, or upgrades.  However, the list of comparable systems is painfully short.  I lucked up and had the exact same setup as one indicated, except for the drives. Process viewer, which is new, gives a greater deal of control and understanding to operating processes (same as the Windows process viewer, just with more options, such as Google this - useful for ID'ing what's running).

Ghost has some redundancy in view progress and performance. Progress is shown during backups anyhow, performance is a useful tool though, to give a sliding scale priority to backups while using other programs, from low (very slow backup) to high (in-use desktop programs take forever, but ghost flies).  My 15 gig test setup compressed to 3 gigs on my backup drive, and the incrementals have been reliably popping up to say they're doing so.

What's different?  System Optimizer includes user level controls (meaning you can, for example, restrict individual accounts or tweak individual accounts - there are also many more options in there now for tweaking and information.  The downside is that settings are still locked to admin level accounts, except for basic things like virus scan.

The main proggy startup has a changed ""Norton Status Screen"" which has been basically rearranged, but offers more immediate acccess to tools freqently used, rather than clicking ""change settings"" or ""more info"".  Some have been renamed/regrouped, such as ""Performance"", which covers auto-protect, spyware, Improve Performance (accesses defrag), clean clutter, fix windows problems (windoctor).  Also new is a Norton Status bar that attaches to the lower right taskbar (the regular task icons still install).  But the Norton Status bar will pop up on startup giving a snapshot of system health, it seems to me a shortcut to the entire program, should things go wrong anywhere. The status bar is NOT system doctor, which is still available via Utilities.

Everything boots smoother and faster, much faster.  Of course, I haven't loaded the system down.  I had tried Iolo's v6, and while I liked it's myriad of utilities (memory defrag and recover, for example, and a slew of others that Norton lacks) it was buggy beyond belief on almost everything else). I suppose, in all fairness, I should have tried a clean boot install of Iolo v6, but even so, its lack of information (just stuff like ""3 spyware programs detected"" without giving info was useless).

Norton's antivirus scans are faster, and sport a new interface.  Registry optimizer is about the same as before, and one button checkup hasn't changed.

With the exception of Norton Ghost (which I love), I would have been disappointed in the upgrade had I purchased regular systemworks... the changes are incremental, rather than monumental. However, they make sense and improve the program, well, incrementally.

One thing I still haven't isolated is use with Windows firewall... I was able to use Norton's worm detection and Windows firewall simultaneously without flaw in Systemworks 2005.  Now when I try to do the same, downloads slow, then stop completely.  It's one or the other, it seems (or install Norton Firewall, which the protection center will suggest (albeit unobtrusively, thank God.

The whole core Norton system, including goback and all is now a 1 button install. Performance test is separate, and strikingly similar to checkit.  There is also a new registration/validation procedure which claims to be designed to resolve the repeat installation errors that plagued 2005 (regular systemworks, anyhow).

Also, during online purchase, I tried to delete the extended backup service, but it would delete the whole order.  This only happened with Premiere, I tried it with other products, and it would not occur.  CD Buyers will not have this issue, of course.

Overall, I am happy with the purchase.  Overclockers beware that a cmos reset, and even some overclockings, will screw the pooch on Systemworks, and require going thru all reinitilizations again (goback, full virus scan, etc.) - At least on my system.  Your mileage may vary.  I've probably missed a few dozen improvements which the Norton folks will protest, and the Iolo folks, well, they will learn from their customers .. but this is where things stand now.

Norton is the 800 lb gorilla because it is the best, in my opinion, even with a few bugs, lack of Norton Utilities update, and some redundancy in functionality. If I had to summarize it another way, it is the best antivirus application around, period, with the best of the available utilities, even if they are significantly limited compared to other upstarts.","Mixed bag, incrementally better, solid (mostly) reliable performance.",False,1130371200,4.74493212836325,1.0

"For many of my clients Quickbooks is a great, powerful program.  Most of my clients don't need the Premier edition, and Quickbooks Pro is more than sufficient.

I don't have anything to add to the conversation about Quickbooks Premier 2014, except when you have greater needs, or say up to a ""zillion"" transactions you have to buy a ""larger"" version of Quickbooks, i.e. up to ""Enterprise"".

Quickbooks in general is the default program with no real alternatives nor competition of which I am aware.  I couldn't tell you another program in the category.  Some folks may still use Peachtree, and Microsoft Money may not exist anymore.  Thanks for not making it any more expensive.

Unless you're just using a spreadsheet (again, not many choices) and want an accounting program QB is pretty much it.

A fine program, despite some of its insidious portions typical of this program and others in the world of software.  I have no idea of its new and improved features.  Perhaps they are also mostly useless bells and whistles as are other updates to other software and hardware updates.

Perhaps I am just a user who doesn't take advantage of many features some of which may actually be helpful, so it may be unfair of me to comment, though I may also be a typical user.  I use a different program for my own accounting, but use this program for some clients' accounting, and use Quickbooks Accountant's version for the most part for clients who use Quickbooks.

I have to buy new programs each year as my clients wind up buying accounting software and buy the latest versions of Quickbooks.  I don't know that they use more than the basic accounting functions of cash receipts, cash disbursements, billing, accounts receivable, and maybe downloading information from his and her bank accounts into the program after using online banking at most.  Quickbooks does make my work easier for delving into client transactions and being able to answer many of my questions and narrowing down the questions that I need to ask clients.

Unless you're ready to pay for annual updates, you may not want to use the payroll part of the program and may want to use a work-around.

"Let me begin by saying that I've only been using Photo Deluxe for a couple weeks, but I'm probably being generous with the 4-star rating.  The fourth star was mainly for the free web-posting capability and Adobe's reputation.  As general use goes, I guess I'd have to give it a three.  First off, as  with prior versions, the step-by-step progression through everything makes  me crazy!  I had hoped that Adobe would have abandoned this for the new  version.  I'm not wild about having to go through all the proceeding steps  to get to the one I want.  Also, I don't care for the way this program sets  up printing, and don't make more than one mistake without saving because  there's only one level of undo, so if you really screw up, you have to  start over from the beginning or your last save point.  And then when you  want to ""save as"" you get to choose the Adobe PDD  format...period, unless you save for e-mail or the web then you get to  choose JPEG and a couple others.  But try to open an Adobe PDD format in  another editing program and you'll more than likely find that you can't do  it.  In it's favor, there's a lot of neat tools here and it's fairly easy  to use.  There's lots of ""cute"" stuff like the clip art and the  seasonal add-ons that the program automatically notifies you of so you can  put the CD in and load it if you're into that sort of stuff. I've spent an  enormous amount of time experimenting with different editing programs over  the last few months looking for a decent one under $100 just for general  purpose use.  I do photography professionally and I use Photoshop 5.5, but  that's another league.

But for about twenty bucks more than Photo Deluxe 4.0  there's Ulead Photo Impact 5.0.  This is a great program!  There's up to 99  levels of undo and great tools and palletts.

I have a new Dell XPS with Win 7 that according to the box, is supported. Going to the Sage website, I created my account as required and followed the link to register. I got to the web page, but the page was blank. I tried again and same thing.

Now the real problem. Next day I launched Explorer to check my email and while I got to the Hotmail page, it was blank. I then tried a couple more websites and same thing. No web content was available. I thought there might be a virus or other issue and launched McAfee. All I got was a blank white box instead of the McAfee dashboard. Other programs that were not web based seemed to work but anything web based was hosed.

"At one time, it was desirable to upgrade prior versions of Money for the free benefits included:  1 year of msn billpay, free tax software, 1 year credit reporting, etc.  It was a no brainer to purchase the new version just for the perks.

The exec's must have felt like Money arrived and was ready to compete head to head with Quicken.  Prior users only get tax software, limited msn billpay, etc.  Financially there is no gain to updating.

The software has trouble functioning and is slow to respond.  One prime example is matching transactions to what is already recorded.  The program moves slow to almost non-responsiveness and cannot keep the visual on a high functioning computer when 1 selection is made to match an item and 2 the correct transactions are linked.  I thought it might be the size of the file, so I archived some of my information.  (Another difficulty found, since the archive selection isn't like Outlooks and you have to archive by duplicating files manually and deleting item by item.)  File size has nothing to do with the poor program functioning at all.

I am at a loss as to why everyone hates this version of Windows so much.  At first I was a bit taken aback by the differences, but with 8.1 most of those differences have been smoothed over.  There is little to no difference in the functionality and capabilities of the underlying OS.

"A number of years ago, I entertained the idea of dictating my articles and or books. Dragon NaturallySpeaking seemed to be the most popular and perhaps most effective software at that time.

I found that the accuracy was shockingly high. But even with such high accuracy, it was almost unreadable. This was very similar to my experience with the Apple Newton. It turned out that very high is not good enough, and  proofreading automated dictation is horrifically difficult, because when dictation software makes a mistake, in inserts a word that no spell check is going to flag -- and your eye tends to see what it expects.

I'm pleased to say however that speech recognition has come a long way, and Dragon Naturally Speaking 9 is so much better at context-based recognition that many previous problem have simply gone away.

Right out of the box it was markedly better, and with just a little effort at training, it is is already incredibly better at recognizing my vocabulary, odd speech, style, etc.

In fact, even though I type very fast (100+), I'm able to dictate documents more quickly than I can type. Corrections are sometimes more difficult using Dragon NaturallySpeaking but there is nothing that prevents me from putting my hands on the keyboard and making corrections manually; and the more I correct, the smarter it gets.

I write software (in addition to books and articles) and for many years it has been my goal to keep a running set of lab notes while I work. I know from personal experience that if I would only write down what I was doing while I was programming. I could save myself a great deal of time (again and again I would fix a problem and then forget the steps and have to reinvent the solution; or I'd wish I knew exactly what order of steps I took that broke what was ""just working."")

Over the years. I've tried keeping a Lab Book, then an open Word document , and at 1 point I purchased an HP Jornada and made my notes in that. The problem with each of these plans was that I had to turn away from whatever I was working on to enter my notes; I quickly gave up on each approach.

My hope is that I can now take contemporaneous notes as I'm working using Dragon NaturallySpeaking on one machine, while programming on the other. If this works out the program will be worth far more than I paid for.

Who knows, maybe my next book will be partially dictated; sure would cut down on the pain in my wrists. In any case, I'm very impressed.

"Like other Amazon reviewers we are dismayed at how remiss a dedicated cartography company like Delorme has been in updating roads and associated ""points of interest"" data on their premier street and travel mapping software, ""Street Atlas 2012"". Thanks to the building and infrastructure slowdowns caused by difficult US economic conditions since 2008, you would think that Delorme would have been able to easily catch up on adding new roads but there appears to be little addition of updated roads over our ""Street Atlas 2009"" version.

At first glance it looks like Delorme has all but given up competing with other online and stand-alone GPS mapping systems in updating their road database, but in their defense it's probably not easy to compete with the deep pocket operations like the freeware ""Google Maps"" and their fleets of roving camera cars circuiting the US and elsewhere.

Despite some needed road updating, Street Atlas does have valuable uses, and we continue to find ""Street Atlas"" an excellent companion for long distance out of state travel, especially with an RV. With a USB, GPS device like Delorme's ""Earthmate"", or their newer ""BU-353"" waterproof GPS unit (that came with the Street Atlas 2012 'Plus' package), even an older marginally powerful Windows laptop can enter service as a full screen GPS travel system showing updated GPS location, as well as travel speed, estimated time to destination, map direction, upcoming turns with voice commands, and the software can even suggest when to start looking for fuel or to stop for the night -- if these details are programmed into the travel parameters before you start driving. You can even set up ""Street Atlas 2012"" to avoid having you make left or right hand turns on your travels (adjusting the route to avoid sitting in busy left hand turn lanes as some delivery companies are known to arrange their routing databases) or to avoid dead end streets, or other blocked egress locations.

The main advantage of ""Street Atlas"" is that a Windows laptop (or potentially a Mac running Windows emulation software) can provide a big screen display showing large map areas as you travel, showing not only your position on the road but large sections of the adjoining countryside. Other GPS systems are much more limited in size and the information that can be shown on the screen.

Our ""Street Atlas"" laptop performs multiple tasks when not running GPS software, like web browsing, e-mail, and tracking expenses so it works as a multipurpose appliance when on the road. If you have the room in your vehicle for a laptop held by some kind of computer mounting stand, GPS software like ""Street Atlas"" is much easier to use and view on a large display than small GPS units or GPS software on smartphones.

""Street Atlas 2012"" looks just like its predecessors, with all the same menus in all the same places and the same quirky buttons for moving around or getting closer or farther from a spot on the map. ""Street Atlas 2012"" has added some easy to use popup type menu features over the 2009 version that makes the program easier to navigate and set up, much like the dialogue boxes seen on small dedicated ""stick on your windshield"" GPS units.

One specific failing that ""Street Atlas"" has always had and is still found in the new version is you must carefully choose the types of roads you are willing to transverse in the ""advanced"" route options menu, and if you do not un-check ""rural"" or ""unimproved"" roads as potential route choices, you might very well find yourself traveling down a rural dirt farm road or numbered lumber trail when there's a divided highway or Interstate just a couple of miles away (funny how Street Atlas will catalog rural farm roads in the middle of nowhere, but omit newer city roads that are likely to receive a lot more interest and use.) Fortunately, with ""Street Atlas"" getting back to a main road is as simple as making a few mouse clicks on the screen so it does make it hard(er) to get lost in unfamiliar areas, but it can happen so it is important to check and cross reference your routes before committing to driving.

For our out of state travel we have always purchased updated copies of ""Street Atlas"" every few years, but with Delorme refusing to update roads and associated ""points of interest"" there's less reason to buy newer versions of the software. For long-distance and cross-country travel you can't beat the many handy features of ""Street Atlas"" but for getting to a specific location after you arrive in town you might want to cross-check your destination with Google Maps... just to be sure.","Street Atlas 2012, little improvements and still worthwhile",False,1348704000,1.9459101490553128,1.0

"Just to let you know, Adobe Premiere Elements, purchased through Amazon a few days ago, is not working as I'd expected it to for the only purpose I bought it for.

I want to quick-edit AVCHD footage from a Canon Vixia G30 so that I can share it on dive boats and other dive travel destinations, where for convenience  I only carry a small HP Pavilion PC running Win 7. (I do my definitive video editing in Final Cut on a MBP, at home.) The computer and software met the Elements requirements as provided online, but playback in the Preview and Work Areas is so jerky that even minimal editing is impossible.

We have spent most of the day trying to identify the problem and correct potential causes without success, though my husband is experienced with Windows and with Elements.

I didn't expect perfect professional-level results from the software, but I do have some standards.  And, as you must know, getting any useful help from Adobe for this brand-new  purchase is going to be a daunting challenge.  Do you have any suggestions?

ADDENDUM: Turns out my PC processor speed is actually NOT up to that required by Elements, and I somehow missed it in the fine print.  $70 down the toilet, not a leg to stand on.

HOWEVER, for a piece of software that retails well over $1,000.00 (US), I'm appalled by the inconsistencies and bugs. In addition, I'm shocked that even though I reported a legitimate bug, they told me directly that they had no idea when it would be fixed - or if it would be fixed at all!!

I have come across scores of other little irritations that I haven't bothered to call in to them because of their poor reception. I routinely am unable to copy script text from one slide to another (instead I have to paste it into an outside text program like Noetpad, recopy it from there and then paste it into the other slide); my menus often refuse to stay open - I have to close and restart the program to clear that one up; and, if I delete a slide, the slide after the deleted one loses any script text which is replaced with the text from slide #1 of the show.

Adobe is known for expensive programs. But I thought they were also known for quality programs.

"Video Capturing.

When video capturing you must understand codec formats. All capturing devices can be programmed to various formats. Formats most associated with DVD's are MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, and those associated with HD are MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 10, AVC, and newer. AVI and mp4 are only container files in which these multiple formats can be placed. These formats are highly compressed and requires very fast processors (cpu, gpu) to get good results in real time. If your computer can't keep up or are marred with errors then you have to use lesser compressed formats such as MJPEG that do not rely so much on the processors. The results, however, will be larger files and require much more disk space, especially with longer movies or surveillance situations. Even with fast systems, this is recommended because the resulted videos will be of higher quality. You can later recompress the videos to DVD's and HD/Bluray with even better quality than trying to do it in one shot. All formats can be adjusted during capturing or finalizing to achieve balanced results. Hope this helps.",Tips For Video Mastering,False,1417824000,0.0,1.0

"Cons: Truly bad support, documentation of error codes is completely non-existent, etc.  They won't help you and you won't be able to help yourself.

This product has been absolutely dreadful for us even though we're using the newest build released just yesterday (5/22/2006).

The backups of files we select seems straightforward and the process tells us the backup was successful, but then when we go to restore from it we get one error message after another (both when trying to back up to DVDs, and then to the hard drive itself [just in case the DVDs was the issue]). Either way, we still have all kinds of error messages and unreliable backup of data using this product.

Oh, and if you need technical support what you get is you send an e-mail and in A FEW DAYS OR SO IF YOU'RE LUCKY someone responds with a canned answer that's useless and has little to do with the problem you've had to describe to them since no one will talk to you on the phone. (If you want to talk to a human you have to pay $29.99, and that's right after you just paid them for the product that never worked once.)

This is truly the worst PC product I've ever had the misfortune of ATTEMPTING to use in over 20 years of doing this, and the company has an attitude problem -- they want your money but they don't want to hear from you (or help you) after they've got it.

For some people the product seems to work, but for those for whom it doesn't, you will find as I do that this company will be little to no help to you at all.

UPDATE:

My problem with this software turned out to be the length limitation on file paths, and since all the backup files are in a tree branch structure of files, some folders plus subfolders plus file names plus the stuff the program adds makes the name too long for the program to handle.  I had to figure this out for myself over two full days (add that to the price of the product!) because Acronis doesn't tell you that (perhaps by including a box  of tips in the backup section) and doesn't provide a list of error codes and what they might indicate as the problem.  Tech support is non-existent unless you want to pay $29.99 per call, and all of this that I went through was completely avoidable.  In fact, I got a hunch the file name length might be the issue from using someone else's product which just plain SAID SO.  If Acronis isn't going to help the user the should provide the means for the user to help himself, but they don't, and even when they add features like the DVD burning feature they don't update the downloadable or web site information about it -- it just shows up as a bullet point on a list of features at the time of this writing.  You may have no problems with this, but if you do you are on your own.  Personally I would look somewhere else for your backup needs just in case something goes wrong and you need answers.

"i'm glad i bought mine discounted a Half Price Books - otherwise i would have felt cheated

first of all - this set is indistinguishable from other survival phrase tutorials - presenting lists of phrases to learn - organized by situation

i'm kinda bewildered at the use of different English speakers with different dialects for the English version of each phrase - but it becomes less distracting as time goes on

a lesser complaint is the Eurocentric nature - ""Can I get a ticket to Prague?"" - admittedly i'm reviewing this while i'm still early in the program - maybe there are Asian destinations in later lessons - i hope so since i would expect to be asking about Asian locales while in Korea - not European ones

there's a certain randomness about way the phrases are presented - well - not quite - they fall within topic groups or lessons - so they aren't quite random - yet - random is how if feels to me since they seldom build one upon the other - the way Pimsleur does - but that's the expensive alternative",first impressions,False,1305936000,1.0986122886681098,0.0

"I've bought both ENCARTA and BRITANNICA for years. This is my opinion:
TEXT: The Britannica is a superb encyclopaedia in text since 1768. If only its electronic version were worthy of it! Text in the electronic version is different from Printed Encyclopaedia (large articles have been shortened). Britannica claims that it has more articles than Encarta, but this is a joke: articles like ""Spain"", are only one with a lot of subdivisions in Encarta, while in Britannica subdivisions are considered articles, and you must ""jump"" from one subdivision to other.
In some areas Encarta is better than Britannica. For example consider ""controversial events in modern history"" such us ""My Lai Massacre"": In Encarta one large article and a lot of mentions in others; Britannica does not even know the name.
In theory, you can update Britannica over the Internet free for a year quarterly (4 times), but this does not work.  Encarta is updated free EVERY WEEK) with new articles and additions to the old ones. The new articles and additions are included in the next version of Encarta, but this is not true for Britannica. For instance: ""Bilbao, Spain"": Britannica does not mention the Guggenheim Museum, which opened in 1997, and the population is !!estimated!! of 1982.  The same article in Encarta: similar text, 3 photos, 1 map, related articles, sidebar, dynamic timelines and 4 internet pages, plus one specific article ""Bilbao Guggenheim Museum"". I think Britannica updates its contents very slow, whereas Encarta is completely alive.
MULTIMEDIA: They say that ""serious"" or ""adult"" readers do not care about ""pictures""; that multimedia is only for kids. I do not agree, because I think that, sometimes, ""A picture is worth a thousand words"". Works of art, anatomy, maps, diagrams ... Encarta devastates Britannica with a lot of photos, paintings, drawings, maps, animations, interactivities, videos, music and sounds, pictures, literature sidebars, new translation dictionaries (not very good though), atlas, 2-D and 3-D virtual tours, timeline, games ...  It's not only the quantity and quality. It is the easy access you have to all the multimedia, and that text and multimedia are fully integrated.  Britannica's Atlas is a joke and statistics do not exist or I have not found them. Encarta's has a great detail: 1 cm/ 4 km all over the world (though you find some mistakes) and hundreds of statistical maps.
INTERFACE AND SOFTWARE:  This is the worst side of Britannica. In Encarta you only have to type a phrase, a word or the beginning of a word to see all the articles and multimedia that contain it.  If you have typed the name of a small village, you see it in the Atlas without clicking again.  If Encarta does not find anything, it gives you alternative spellings and you find what you were looking for.  To go ""jumping"" from article to article is very easy and quick, because you have a lot of links and the ""Related Articles"" section.  If you need to copy text or pictures, the integration with Microsoft WORD is perfect. If you don't understand a word, you can double-click it and the dictionary appears in a window.
Navigating with Britannica is different. You get crazy. I will only give an example: if you do not know the exact and correct spelling of a name or word, it does not help you with alternative or similar spellings. The dictionary does not permit double-clicking of words in the text of articles for their definitions. Once an article is displayed you cannot search for a word within the article. This is extremely annoying: you have to perform this task yourself.  One ""pro"" for Britannica: they say it works with Macintosh computers.
This is my piece of advice: If you can afford it, buy both. If not... read again this review.","Very good content, very good software, very good product.",False,1040947200,2.3978952727983707,1.0

"I have noticed favorable reviews here, with the reviewer asserting intimate knowledge and experience with this suite, its forerunners, or several other programs.  I cannot address how someone with a decade of experience might react to this tangled mess, only how someone with slight familiarity with a paint program or similar might react.

First, opening the box and installing the programs is a chore.  Unlike the dozens of other programs I have on my system, rather than taking half an hour, or so, installing these programs took the better part of two afternoons...it was if the developers consciously decided to find another way, rather than standards users are familiar with, to do everthing.  Particularly annoying this the spyware, in the guise of searching for updates, which is at least difficult to remove, if not impossible.  The tool which Corel, alone among software developers, seems to have been forced to put in their help files on their inadequate site, doesn't work, at least the way the instructions read.  Hopefully, with several manhours more effort this spyware can be removed from my system.

Worse than this though is the tutorial, presumably for first time users to familiarize themselves and get started with this product.

First lesson ""Using the toolbar to start a drawing""

On the toolbar click ""New"" button to start a new drawing...so far, so good.  This desirable state of events quickly ends, however, for the second instruction begins""

""From the Zoom levels list box""...and nothing more.  No hint where this box may be found, nothing in the totally inadequate help file nothing....the ""tutorial"" is then over for the new user.

Sharing from program to YouTube automatically allows you to share to YouTube using YouTube's 3D viewing options...

To share 3D video generated with this program to FB, ONLY working option I've found so far is to save the file to your hard disk, then go to FB and use FB's own file upload options to upload the 3D format video file in the viewing format you intended to be shared on FB.

The games look like they were made in the 80s, they also run slow because they are all coming from a CD Rom. The vocabulary is merely okay. They show you the item and you're supposed to pick what it is. Honestly, it's not that difficult to mess that up. I was very disappointed in the voice/microphone aspect of it. With instant immersion you speak into the microphone, but the program doesn't grade/rate how well you did it. It just records it, so you can listen to yourself again. What good is that? In Rosetta Stone, the program actually determines how well you said it and gives you a rating, this really helped me improve my accent. Also for vocabulary, you can get an even better program and it's FREE. Go to SpanishDict com and their flashcard games are great. They even have video lectures, which are also free. Back to Instant Immersion, the grammar portion seemed okay, it involved you putting random phrases in the correct order.

"The main reason I got the Dazzle DVD recorder was to copy my VHS tapes to DVD.  Mostly I have instructional videos and a few old videos from a trip.  So far, I guess the Dazzle is doing what it says it does, but not without causing a lot of frustration first.  I had problems installing both the Instant DVD Recorder software, and Pinnacle Studio.  Instant DVD froze twice, and I had to restart the computer both times.  Pinnacle Studio also froze twice.  The 2nd time I was trying to install it froze when it appeared to be almost finished, it said it was configuring the software.  After about 10 minutes I had to ctrl alt delete and close it.  But it must have finished installing cause it was on my computer and working.

The first thing I tried to do with it was try using Studio to edit some mini DV home movies that I want to put on DVD.  My camcorder instructions say it can be connected to the computer with a USB cable, but Pinnacle Studio couldn't detect the camcorder and says it must be connected with a firewire cable.  I don't have one of those, so I went looking for the S-video cable to hook it up through the Dazzle.  Tore the house apart looking for it, but couldn't find it, so I can't comment on how well it works with that.  I decided to try VHS to DVD using Studio.  The video it recorded was choppy and the sound was garbled.  I thought maybe the VHS tape was bad, so I tried a different one.  Same as the first.

I couldn't figure out what the problem was with Pinnacle Studio, so I tried the Instant DVD software to do the transfer.  I recorded 5 minutes of a VHS tape (I didn't want to waste my time if it was going to be garbled too), it recorded fine.

Although I was able to create a video CD of the wedding after about one month of hell, it was the most painstaking experience I've ever had with any software.  The bugs are endless, and the technical support is non-existent.  Pinnacle expects their customers to offer each other support based on their own trial and error.  I experienced intermittent software crashes (so I saved often), aborted rendering after 99% of the video was completed (this was apparently my fault for using too many dissolves, 3 total!), and glitches with audio/video being out of sync.  With every software problem I overcame, I became more determined to complete the project.  In the end I was extremely disappointed with the quality of the VCD that Studio 8 finally produced after all the time I had invested, as it was much poorer than the original filmed footage.  Pinnacle explained that the Linx USB cable allows a maximum resolution that is about equal in quality to a VHS tape, which I accepted when I bought it, but it turned out much worse than this.  Their new Moviebox USB, which replaces Linx USB in capability, supposedly offers twice the resolution, but I don't trust that it will work any better from the negative reviews I've read.

I've also noticed a slight increase in battery life although I don't know if this could be attributed to Snow Leopard or the fact that the battery has been cycled properly and is now conditioned. Bottom line, if you're looking for a solid update to an already solid OS (Leopard), then Snow Leopard is well worth the $29.",A Solid Upgrade from an Already Solid OS,False,1257206400,0.0,1.0

"A significant number of people have complained on here that they had trouble installing X2 or that it locked up on them or that it will not run on Win7. All I can say is that I have used X2 heavily (on Windows 7) since I got it a couple of months ago and never had a problem of any kind. I had no trouble installing it after removing PSP 9.0 and it has never locked up or glitched on me in any way.

I have three 22-24"" monitors (they're dirt cheap these day -- about $170 on Amazon). I put all the X2 tool boxes on the left one and the Organizer (with all the thumbnails for a folder full of pictures) on the right one and work full screen on the middle one. I don't know if I could have done this with PSP 9, but I never did and I love this arrangement.

One of the windows I keep open on the left monitor is the tutor (""Learning Center""), which helps with any features I'm not used to. But I've had no trouble adjusting to the new format for old features which I've always used.

I'm not going to get into all the features, which other reviewers have done. I just wanted to offer an opposing view to some of the 1-star reviewers who say X2 won't install or won't run. I'm not claiming that it will run on all systems, just that it works for me. The funny thing is that if you look at PhotoShop Elements 8 reviews on Amazon, it has a lower average rating, more 1-2 star reviews, and a lot fewer 5-star reviews, yet it costs twice as much. Which just goes to show that you can't please everyone.

Bottom line: the upgraded and new features were well worth $30 (even $40) and I am very happy with this purchase. It doesn't even bother me that a newer version has come out, since if it had not been for the low price of X2, I would still be using PSP 9.

"As a long time AppleWorks user, it's great to see that Apple finally got around to writing a *modern* word processor in Pages.  AppleWorks had grown quite long in the tooth and the user experience was basically unchanged from Mac OS 9.  Not a big fan of Word (too slow, UI inconsistent with the rest of OS X), I had grown used to using the bundled TextEdit program which comes with every Mac.  TextEdit takes advantage of OS X system wide features like as you type spell checking, speech, floating font and color palettes, etc..  However, TextEdit can't do advanced things like multi columns, wrapping text around pictures, etc..  So the choices on the OS X platform were rather meager - slow an inconsistent Word, underpowered TextEdit, or old and clunky AppleWorks (aside from a few other third party tools which aren't very widely used).

Pages is basically TextEdit on steroids - all of the major features 95% of people expect a word processor to have are present and much easier (and faster) to use than in Word.  The regular OS X features such as customizable toolbar, floating font and color palettes, as you type spell checking, etc. are all present.  Moving graphics around is quick and seamless even on a slightly older Mac (667MHz G4).  Also, the import and export options seem to work very well from my limited testing - most importantly, it imports and exports from Word without any problems that I can see.

Sure, there are some things which Word can do that Pages can't, but most of them are not things I'll ever use any way.  I'd much rather have an easy to use and efficient word processor than have to deal with Word.

Keynote 2 (the other half of iWork) is also a great program.  I can't really compare it to PowerPoint since I haven't used Powerpoint much, but I have to say that it was incredibly easy to learn how to use.  The master styles are very handy for applying consistent features across your presentation, and the transitions and animation effects are nifty looking as well as easy to create.  The import and export from Keynote to Powerpoint also seems to work seamlessly.  It also allows you to export as QuickTime, Flash, PDF, etc..

Given my background working on world-class and well-known enterprise and consumer software packages, I feel qualified to say that I have watched this product steadily deteriorate over that time.

I stumbled upon yet another unfixed (undocumented, but known) problem in their TCPIP interface.

"As a hobby on the weekends I run an AV team (five crew members) of gaming junkies that help run a youtube channel devoted to gaming and not all of us have enough discretionary income to purchase MacBooks and/or Final Cut Pro X.  As such it was a real treat to test out both Corel VideoStudio Ultimate and Pro X7 (for more information on Pro, see respective product for more) and we've had very positive feedback on the Ultimate edition.

Our co-founder and marketing expert Tom tried the Ultimate version and quickly discovered that his laptop was not only grossly obsolete (Windows 7) but most of the features exclusive to the ultimate edition are more gimmicky than utilitarian.

After find Tom a suitable computer to work on, he began working on a Legend of Zelda project using in game footage we captured with an Elgato capture card and some live-action sequences we filmed.  One of the first things he began to experiment with was the 3D plug-in and quickly disregarded when his new PC didn't feel like supporting them that and we have no need for them.  The other premium plug-ins were the Hollywood-esque transitions and titles but they still resembled something a high school or film student makes in his bedroom so they're not that great.

However, what Ultimate missed in its plug-ins it makes up for in its comprehensive layout and use.  While not as streamlined as Final Cut Pro X, it still had a very easy-to-understand layout even for rookies like Tom to understand and master quickly.  The software is, relatively, user-friendly and that is a plus to anyone that doesn't feel like shelling out over $1000 in premium software or Mac products like I did.

All in all, I would probably recommend Pro over Ultimate since the premium features on the latter are less professional than one would think.  I'd keep things simple.","Gimmicky Features, but Solid AV Editor for Those That Aren't Necessarily Mac Fans",False,1400025600,0.0,1.0

"newnovelist isn't worth anywhere near fifty dollars. The story types/categories are extremely limiting and don't even come close to portraying the full range of possible genres that a novel can fall into. Once you finish the ""wizard"" (which is where you title your story and choose a category) the program isn't interactive at all. There are no prompts and the help is vague and doesn't cover more than the most basic principles of how a novel is structured. You learn more about writing a novel by reading good books than you do from newnovelist's help sections. There's no text/grammar editor. There's not even a spellcheck. The one saving grace is that it does allow you to take extremely detailed notes about every possible element of your novel, and to access them conviently while you're writing. However, it doesn't offer any help in creating a timeline or outline for your story, so there's no real way to bring those notes together. All it has is a universal notes section where you can write your own timeline without any help from the program. It's slightly more convienient than keeping your notes in Windows Notepad and having it minimized while you work, but outside of it's organizational properties, it does virtually nothing. Microsoft Office 2000 offers more in depth and useful advice about writing structure and style than newnovelist does.

"I'm happy to say that I am -- for the most part -- very pleased with this upgrade so far.  I came from Vista 32-bit, and I have now officially entered the 64-bit era by installing Windows 7 x64.  For quite a few months I read about people's experiences with the betas and release candidates, and was excited about the good news I kept hearing.  I decided to just be patient and put in for my pre-order like most people did, which meant waiting for the October 22nd release date.

Let's go through this topic by topic...

INSTALLATION: It was easy, almost too easy.  For some reason I was half expecting to wait more than an hour to get this on my machine, but instead I was up and running in roughly 25 minutes or so (I performed a clean install, not an upgrade).  And on top of that, all of my primary devices were recognized (see the end of my review for complete system specs).  The Windows Easy Transfer utility was an enormous help in getting my user identity and files into my new configuration.

USER INTERFACE: Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3-D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy -- if not more -- while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements.  It just seems like a great deal of effort was put forth into making everything slick, polished, and logically consistent, and I've already fallen in love with many of the additional improvements, such as the revamped and more versatile taskbar, jump lists, and customizable themes.  I haven't yet become accustomed to some features like Aero Shake, but hey, those things are there if I need them.  But the clean, ""keep it simple"" approach, the attention to detail, and even minimalism in certain areas is certainly appreciated.  And sure, some people might scoff at the shiny facade and dismiss certain parts of it as being ""bells and whistles,"" but honestly, isn't it actually USEFUL to have the ability to see full-screen previews of running applications, or to be able to hide all of your open windows and take a quick glance at what's underneath?  All of these niceties simply add up to a more functional and usable desktop.

PERFORMANCE: I think it's actually better than Vista.  Overall the system feels more responsive and, well, ""snappier"" (especially with regards to video performance).  Gaming is as smooth as could be.  No complaints as far as startup, shutdown, and resuming from sleep mode are concerned.

STABILITY: Very good, but I'll give 7 an A- here.  I got just ONE blue screen of death so far, and that was during the installation of a particular piece of software (I forget what it was to be honest -- maybe a browser plug-in).  Other than that, it's been rock-solid, with absolutely no crashes.  I've even gone through some software development debugging sessions in which the program I was working on was repeatedly throwing up on me, and Windows 7 recovered gracefully every time.

SOFTWARE COMPATIBILITY: Pretty high marks, but not perfect.  I think some of it has to do with my transition to 64-bit anyways, like the fact that I'm having trouble with a specific component in Visual Basic 5 (I use it to support a piece of software I designed for work).  No big deal, though -- I'm going to circumvent it by using my copy of Windows XP in Sun's VirtualBox to run it, so problem solved.  Another issue I had was the fact that the installation of Samsung Media Studio 5 (for my MP3 player) causes Windows Media Player to fail to launch when I try to open a media file, but again, that's not a show-stopper because I can manipulate that device directly in the OS anyways without that application.  And don't laugh, but it looks like I might have to give up Publisher 95.  Heh heh ... yeah, I've been using that program for years now to do miscellaneous desktop publishing, but guess what?  Its installer is 16-bit.  So again, that's a 64-bit lack of support for 16-bit issue, not really a problem with Windows 7 per se.  Plus I guess I could still run it in my virtual XP machine if I wanted to.  Other than those snags I just mentioned, the majority of my applications and games run just fine -- and thank goodness Cakewalk Music Creator still works with my MIDI and audio interface devices.

WINDOWS LIVE ESSENTIALS: I guess it was a smart move on behalf of MS.  A little less bloat for people who would rather choose alternatives to those programs, but still available as a free download.  Personally I feel that Microsoft has been blessed with a lot of talented people who are really experts at design -- the basic necessities such as Live Mail and Calendar (and all of the other apps) are wonderful in my opinion.

OTHING THINGS I LIKE: The Devices section in the Control Panel is now much better, and ejecting USB devices is quicker and easier.  User switching works flawlessly.  I'm a big fan of the ""ribbon,"" which is the new user interface mechanism and visual style that is incorporated into the built-in tools such as Paint and WordPad -- I find it to be very fresh and innovative.  I'm looking forward to upgrading from Office XP to Office 2010!  (Even Calculator is better!)

BUGS OR QUIRKS: The link for opening the backup applet is broken, but not when it is launched via the new Action Center.  Also, unlike in Vista, Mozilla Firefox seems to have developed this strange problem of occasionally reporting that it can't find the server when I try to connect to certain websites that are listed in the results of a Google search -- but when I click the browser's ""back"" button, the site will then appear (and usually sites load properly when they are opened via the Bookmarks menu or through other search engines).  Internet Explorer 8 doesn't exhibit this behavior at all, and the problem has started to bother me so much that I finally decided to install Google Chrome as my default browser (I tried resetting my router, and it didn't seem to have any effect).

In summary, I think Microsoft did the right thing by listening to its users and trying to correct Vista's shortcomings, whether real or just perceived.  I can't say this is a revolution; it's more like evolution (boy, how many times has THAT been said about a software product?).  But to me it's a step in the right direction, and if things stay the course, Windows could have a bright future.

"I have all 50 of the DeLorme State map books.  They have good topo features and decent references to parks, points of interest, etc.  When DeLorme put the maps on a disk with a GPS connection I thought navigating would be a breeze.  I cannot tell you how much time I have wasted plotting routes on this software.  I used it on a 22,000 mile road trip/photo shoot in 2005. I work in out-of-the-way areas.  The database maps (both street and topo)have no detail in national or state parks.  They generally do not even show where the visitor centers are located. They do not show the points of interest in the parks.  They are just big green blobs on the screen with a line running through showing the basic road that transverses the park land.  The maps have absolutely no topo features like the books.  That is another software subscription.  The Topo map program (which I also bought for the 2005 trip) did not have the trip planning functionality that the road atlas program has and does not provide worthwhile topo features in the public lands.  The topo program is almost amatureish in its renderings and if you want to use the split map and see an elevated view, you get very little useful information for planning.  Certainly, with national lands and the trails in them being absent from the data bases of both the street and topo products, it offers minimal help to the hiker.
Notwithstanding my dissatisfaction with the 2005 street and topo products, before I embarked on the current journey (I have been on the road 2 1/2 months as I write), I bought the 2008 street map disc (it is not an upgrade, you buy new each time).  As with the 2005 version, the GPS periodically tells me that I am off route, as the cursor shows me tracking across farm fields, etc., maybe where the road used to go years ago. Frustrated by all of this, I went back to my Garmin Quest.  It also leaves a lot to be desired but it is more reliable.  If you get the DeLorme gps, spend at least a day learning the basic functions. There is little intuitive about its operation. Spend another day in your computer setting your waypoints (roads, towns, addresses, etc.)that you may be traveling the next few weeks and run a couple tests to see how well the program maps your route.  I often have to go into the route and force the most direct route by adding via/waypoints along the way that simply looking at the map makes clear.  If you try to do this while traveling, you will spend more time on your computer than driving.  I am on a 6 month journey right now and have simply removed the DeLorme programs from my computer and only rely on the Garmin to get me through or around metropolitan areas.  Otherwise the paper DeLorme state atlases and basic state maps guide me.  Finally, don't rely on the program to have up to date comprehensive info on lodging, points of interest, etc.  All have some, but in the last month none of the programs have guided me to one location where I ended up spending the night. For every one RV park that showed up from the data base, I saw one or two more in the same area that were better.  And if you have an ""air card"" for your laptop, you can use the Google maps and get traffic info along the way.",Two & 1/2 years of giving it a nationwide test--very cumbersome & marginally reliable,False,1194912000,2.19722457733622,0.0

"I have purchased Easy Media Creator 8, 9 and now 10. I have been disappointed with them all but have always given Roxio a second chance with each new release.

I recorded a TV musical in MPEG2 format.

I used Roxio's MyDVD to make the DVD's. So far these are the problems you can expect to see when using this program:

All the video is un-synced to the audio by half a second. It did not matter whether I used MPEG2 video or WMV video files.

What you see on the screen is not what you get. Even though I meticulously manually made every chapter marker, the program decided to place them all one second ahead where I chose, creating unintended effects and losing the impact intended.

The video quality varies and looks acceptable in some sections and looks unacceptable in others.

Yesterday my first DVD attempt, for this project, produced a DVD that did not start at the beginning the the movie, even though I tested the playback of the DVD on the DVD Menu tester. It was supposed to start at the beginning as designed. Instead it started five minutes into the DVD, which was not even a chapter marker location. In fact, with that DVD I did yesterday I had not set up any chapter markers.

Conclusion: Roxio MyDVD is a program to be avoided. It is unreliable and therefore unusable. If one program is unreliable in the suite, how can anyone trust the rest of the software?

"I successfully installed Vista Home Basic on my laptop, and whilst being far from overwhelmed with the product nevertheless believed it to be a step up from XP**.  I then decided to 'upgrade' my desktop PC to Vista Home Premium, and boy I am wishing I had never even started that process.  I used Upgrade Advisor, and confirmed that my PC was fine, and then satisfactorily installed Vista, but then the problems started.  First off: Vista is significantly slower than XP, and that slowness becomes creeping until your PC virtually stops to allow Vista to do basic chores one takes for granted in XP.  Suddenly, your PC can spring back into life, and all seems okay, then ..... back into the slow lane again.  Also, Vista has fallen into the Adobe trap - it is much more invasive than XP and wants to take control of your life, not just your PC.

Pehaps I could have adjusted to its way of doing things, after all at 40 something years old, I'm no young Turk, and the onset of grey hairs and a fear of social networking makes me a techno-geriatric, however Vista gave me no opportunity to adjust.  You see the software kept crashing!  When I say crashing, I mean that the PC would switch itself off and re-boot (I don't mean anything so gentlemanly as log-off or shut down, I mean power off in an instant).  It kept doing this, and I could find no pattern to its decision making in this respect.  Plug in a thumb drive - CRASH!  Adjust a couple of photos in Photoshop - CRASH!  Browse the web - hmm, seems to like this .... - CRASH!.  I didn't try everything I could to solve the problem, but I gave it a good attempt for a couple of weeks, and I have no patience left in my soul for the condescending remarks of an ultimately hopeless support system.

My PC worked fine for a long time with XP.  My PC now seems to be working fine again - with XP.  Yes, the solution for me was to scrub Vista and re-install XP.  Hey Vista looks nicer/more contemporary or whatever, but XP works.

In summary, if you are thinking about upgrading to Vista, please think long and hard.  It is prettier than XP, but it offers very little added functionality.  The killer though, is that it is very unreliable - you may be lucky, but in my view luck should have nothing to do with it.  An operating system should work, all the time.  Vista doesn't.

**  The reason for me moving to Vista was for the much better sound capability it offers.  I use my laptop as a music player through my main hifi and Vista's handling of high quality sound is much better than XP.  On my laptop Vista has been a success.

So there we go - one reasonably competent computer user, and a 50% success rate at switching to Vista.","No, don't do it!",False,1216771200,2.4849066497880004,0.0

"Working with Final Cut Express

Creating titles and credits with Express is important. The key is the Video Generator. You can create synthesized clips that you superimpose over your existing video clips in the Final Cut Express Timeline.

For good-looking titles, you can use san serif fonts such as Arial, Futura, Gill Sans, Helvetica and Impact. I have found using bold, red or blue 30 point fonts effective for my titles.

You need to watch for the 20 percent factor. The 'Title Save Boundary' is 20 percent smaller than your television screen. To see the boundaries in Final Cut Express, go to View then to Show Title. Best to keep your titles within the safe zone.

Final Cut Express allows you to create rolling credits like the credits at the end of a movie. You can set the duration of your video clips plus set the in and out points for speed of the text and scrolls.

Looking at Final Cut Express Storyboard

Storyboard gives me a visual look at my movie. I control-click the Final Cut Express browser and choose large icon new. Then, I drag the clips into the order that I want them to be played. Next, I click on the project's tab in the Browser and save it. Finally, I save the entire project.

Now to add my new storyboard to Final Cut Express 4 sequences. Draw a marquee around the Storyboard clips. Next, I drag the clips from my Final Cut Express Browser to my Timeline and save the project. To protect them, I can lock them to make sure that they cannot be modified. I can lock and unlock them with the F4 key for video tracks and the F5 key for audio tracks.

Pro Reaction

Express allows you to import iMovie projects. You can also import your Final Cut Express project to iDVD complete with special chapter marker. Express comes with an excellent hardcopy paper manual for learning how to use Final Cut Express 4. The manual is easy to follow without computer jargon.

Con Reaction

You have to work at learning how to use the Final Cut Express application. You have to spend the time to read and work with the Final Cut Express manual.

You cannot capture DV across time-code breaks. You cannot import your Final Cut Express project to iMovie or QuickTime with chapter markers and comments.

"I've watched Quicken reviews for 2 years now and they've terrified me. I feel like there are many factors surrounding the large number of negative, mediocre, and positive comments.

The negative comments seem to be a combination of folks who have been legitimately screwed by the upgrade, people who are mad at Intuit for their lukewarm business practices, and people with a ""pile-on"" mentality.

The positive comments seem to be posted by individuals who live a charmed life filled with kittens and rainbows...oh, and unicorns. The conspiracy theorists might even say that the positive reviews are shills.

I settled in on the middle of the road.

I was genuinely afraid that the upgrade from 2012 to 2014 would ruin my day. I performed all manner of preparatory work by backing up, finding previous install media, performing last rites...anything I could think of to allow for a recovery from the impending disaster which would soon befall me.

The installation went fine.

The data migration went fine.

The program opened and functioned fine.

The registration went fine.

The data download from my accounts was ALMOST flawless. I did have to reenter one of my passwords (not sure why).

I am REALLY glad that, so far, my functionality is unbroken. Thanks Intuit!

The reason I am only giving 3 stars is that there doesn't seem to be any wow factor or compelling reason for me to have moved to the 2 year newer version. I understand that there are some mobile features and some cloud items, but this doesn't FEEL any different...or LOOK any different. Maybe for the masses that is a good thing. Heck, the Premier icon is not even any different. At least the TurboTax program updated the icon.

Look, I am not a Quicken or Intuit hater. I really like what Quicken has added to my life over the last MANY years. The chore of personal finances is much less onerous and cumbersome thanks in large part to Quicken. THANKS Intuit.

Intuit, please modify your business model with regard to Quicken (and possibly TurboTax). PLEASE consider getting OFF the ""every year major release"" merry-go-round. Go to a model where incremental releases are available across years for a more modest fee...or even free. I don't think the basic code changes completely from one year to the next. You already force users to upgrade every 3 years to get downloads (that seems smarmy, but I digress). How about a major release window of every three years? Maybe a subscription for online services that includes updates to the software? Or, something else completely. It seems obvious from reading the comments on Amazon that a great deal of people are not delighted by the status quo.

At least think about it.

"I bought this game 3 years ago for my son (now 8) and he loved it.  I didn't like the language- they say ""stupid"" quite a bit.  And I didn't like the way the characters make fun of you if you don't do well.  And I didn't like how there are movie-type scenes that they have to watch to get to the next game.  You can't skip over these.  But he loved it and it did teach him basic chess skills.  However, the game ONLY works if the CD is in the computer.

Eventually, I decided to purchase LtPC 2 (see my even lower review for that!) for my son and to purchase this game again for my daughter, age 5.

My daughter is a spunky girl who has no trouble standing up for herself so it must be quite upsetting for her to not want to play the game.  I'm fed up with these games.

"My rating reflects the fact that you can buy this elsewhere in Amazon for 1/2 the price.  At the lower price I think BitDefender 2010 Total Security is internet security software the way it should be built.

The installation asks you what type of user you are, with the choices of typical, gamer, parent, and a fourth choice I forgot. It then asks if you are a beginner, intermediate or advanced computer user. It then sets up the software based on your answers. Though advanced, I choose intermediate since I do not want to think about computers when I get home. I think the setup turned out perfect for me.

The newest version scans almost twice as fast as BitDefender 2009 and is far less resource intensive. I always thought BitDefender was efficient relative to other internet software, but 2010 has made another jump in performance. I was able to play Fallout 3, run a scan, and not notice a problem.

I like Total Security over other versions of BitDefender since it has all the features I want such as a registry optimizer and file backup. These are not available on other versions of BitDefender.

Of course, ""Does the software protect well?"" Results vary between different testers, but in general BitDefender does very well relative to others. But I work part time in IT security and I know keeping your software up to date and running scans regularly is more far more important than the type of software. Caveat, I do not use the parental controls or spam filter.

So why not five stars? I do not think there is such a thing as five star internet security software. First, all security software will have problems running on some computers. I have had Norton and TrendMicro not work on home computers, and read cases of Kapursky, and McAfee not running on other computers. I am sure BitDefender 2010 will have problems on some computers. Second none give great technical support. I have a four year computer science degree and I struggle to understand all security software technical support.

The main advice I tell people is go to an internet security site and try an evaluation copy. If it works and you like it, then buy a copy from Amazon where it will be cheaper. You can usually just plug the registration key in the software package into your evaluation copy. I have tried recent copies of McAfee, Norton, Kapursky, McAfee, TrendMicro and Avast.

"I just finished using this software this past weekend to transfer all of the stuff from my old computer to the new and it worked great. I'm baffled at the problems that the other reviewers had with it. I had no trouble with it at all, very simple to use, on screen step by step instructions.  Like the other reviewers, I found that the time involved was way off from what the instructions said, but I can only assume that, that is because the makers of the software have no idea how much and what kind of data we each have in our computers, so the time is just a very rough estimate on transfering standard data. I store tons of pictures in mine so I assumed that is one reasons it took so long, about 12 hours.  I just let it do it's thing while I did other things, even went to bed and it was done when I got up, and my new computer looked just like my old one, right down to the wallpaper I had on my old computers desktop.

"There's not a lot in the box.  It's a single hardcover book and a card with access to an online website where you do most of the activities.  It's possible to use this program using an app on your tablet/phone, although using it on a phone is probably a bad idea because of the small screen size.  I think it should be possible to use a computer to access this program, but it doesn't seem to work very well.

Once you get online, it plays a bit like a video game, with very simple animations. The games start out very simple (identifying letters) and eventually progress in difficulty (actual reading activities).  It's made by Rosetta Stone, and if language experts can't be trusted to teach reading, well....

Ultimately, what holds me back from a 5-star rating is:
- This is a subscription-based service, not software that you can own forever like my other Rosetta Stone products. There is no CD in the box, only an online code.  Nowhere on the product is it made particularly obvious that this is a subscription-based product
- While you can access the program using an app, you cannot use the app to register for the service - for that you need a full-feature browser.
- Characters in the software seem to have exactly three positive responses and three negative responses.  That is nowhere near enough for Daddy, who feels the need to throw his tablet out the window every time he hears ""Uh-huh"".
- Wifi is a must, so we can't use this in our car or on trips.  It does not work offline.
- There is a really annoying video that pops up every single time you log into the website that you can't really skip over.  It's a small thing, I know, but the video is a good 20 seconds long and isn't even being used as a way to cover up loading the next screen or anything.

Many of these are small annoyances.  I think that with fewer of them, this is a 5-star product, but it has some growing to do first.",Small annoyances...,False,1417651200,1.0986122886681098,0.0
"I previously used Quicken 2007 for Mac and with the impending release of Lion for the Mac, I needed to find a new personal finance solution or upgrade to Quicken Essentials for Mac.  After trying various other solutions, I decided to go ahead and upgrade to QEM as there were little things that bothered me about the other solutions I tried.  Am I frustrated that QEM only offers a subset of the functionality that Quicken 2007 has?  Yes.  But it's not fair to dis this product for that reason.  Intuit was very upfront with what this version supports and the differences between 2007 and this version.  So for what this product says it does, then I have to say it actually does it pretty well.  However, I did encounter an issue with the product and support was of no use.

I decided to start with a new file, so I can't comment on the import capability, but it does exist.  I was able to quickly setup my bank accounts and transactions downloaded without any issue.  I wasn't able to directly connect to my investment accounts.  While this version has very limited abilities when it comes to investment accounts, I was hoping it would at least grab the overall portfolio value and update that, but it does not.  I have to go to my investment accounts, export a file and then import that into QEM.

There are a few other quirks that bug me and a few features that I miss.  There is no implied decimal anymore, so I have to enter that.  I don't like the way the categories are displayed.  I liked the old drop down box behavior over this big window that pops up with all the categories and they filter down as you type away.  When I create a new transaction, the date field is selected and specifically the month is selected.  I hit the TAB key to move to the date field, but I guess I do it to quickly, as the day field highlights but then it quickly goes back to the month being selected.  Very annoying.  Also don't like the fact that dates have to be entered as 7/20/2011 rather than 7-20-2011.  I do like the way I can reconcile my statements and it seems to be much quicker for me now versus in 2007.

After using the product for about two months, I was all of a sudden no longer able to download transactions from my bank anymore.  I searched online with the error message that was reported and tried the steps that were suggested to no avail.  I opened up a support case and they quickly responded with the same steps I found earlier.  After telling them that those steps did not resolve the issue, they told me that it's likely an issue with their servers and that they would escalate the issue.  I waited several days with no response.  I then sent a follow-up email asking for an update and that went unanswered as well.  Another few days go by and I sent another request for an update.  And again, I get no response.  Now I've gone over a week with no ability to update.  At this point, I troubleshoot further by creating a new file and resetting up my accounts.  Surprisingly, it worked!  So this told me there was something wrong in my original file, but unable to get any response from support, I was forced to start all over again with a new file.  I'm hoping this doesn't happen again.

In the end, I give the product 4 stars for what it does.  I would give their support 1 star.  If the problem I had appears again, then my rating on the product would definitely go down.  I'm still hoping they release a new version that brings back all the missing features from 2007, but at this point, I'm not holding my breath.",Good for what it does,True,1311033600,0.0,1.0

"Ok. I wanted to learn about these techniques because frankly, mind control fascinates (and scares) me. But this book is just HORRIBLE. It is loaded with cryptic, needlessly esoteric psychobabble and complex metaphors as well as thousands of random historical facts about MI6, the CIA, the FBI, Joseph Mengele, African tribesmen, etc all strung together randomly and using no particular time line. He jumps around so much that you wonder if he himself has multiple personalities or wrote this entire book stream-of-consciousness. I am being completely serious! In the very beginning of the book, he defines several mind control terms that will be used throughout each chapter (such as ""alter""), but this really does not help the reader along much because the problem is his writing style, which consists mainly of run-on sentences and extremely long-winded paragraphs that make no cognitive sense initially. This book was CLEARLY not edited by a professional. At times it is so densely packed with information that you literally have to read a single sentence 6 or 7 times to infer its meaning. Below is an example of what I am talking about. This is only a PORTION of a single paragraph (not the entire paragraph, which goes on for almost an entire page without a break):

""In Illuminati systems these early parts are dehumanized into thinking
they are gems and crystals. These gems and crystals then ""power"" the
entire mind-control system that is programmed over the following years
into the child's mind. The gems are not perceived as alters, so the proxy
core wouldn't integrate with what is perceived as an inanimate object.
The proxy core is allowed to want to move toward health with a therapist,
it is programmed to move toward healing, but to lead the therapist away
from the true core. She or he is programmed to believe it is the true
core. The real core & its first splits, which are the gems, are placed
hypnotically at the mind's deepest levels--in an area of the mind few
therapists ever search.""

How could anyone possibly understand this without some kind of ""decoder ring""? This is actually one of the more *simplistic* sections of the book! The whole thing reads like a technical manual.

For me that's $800.00. Second, H&R insisted on using form 8917 for a tuition deduction instead of form 8863 for the college tax credit that I deserved. Believe me it took a lot of research to figure out that I did qualify for the credit. That would have cost me $1000.00 refund.  A minor point, it also makes it a challenge if you have 3 cars and want to deduct the registration fees. It can be done but it does flag the ""other tax"" and asks for a notation on the tax form.
For grins I used Turbo Tax deluxe on line. I used bogus personal data but my real numbers. TT got the return correct, and I got an additional $1100.00 return.  H&R was cheaper but in my case it cost a bunch of extra time and possibly a lot of money in refund.

"I bought this product at Sam's Club and excited about the idea of making my own cookbook with my recipes.  I have spent the afternoon messing with it and am very disappointed. I found the help screen confusing.  It took me a whole hour to figure out how to import a picture into the recipe and it was not as easy as the direction indicated.

The cookbook idea is fine if you don't mind one recipe per page by alphabetical order.  To do even this one has to put the desired recipes in a ""meal plan.""  That seems illogical to me.  I was hoping to be able to organize by type of dish, but unless one labels it by the type of food first,but that won't happen unless you label each recipe something  like ""Bread - Basic Biscuits.""

It is rather easy to copy a recipe from a word document and paste it into the program to enter the recipe.  It does have some nice features in this part that made that process relatively easy once I got the hang of it.

Most of my current recipes are already in a nice word document with a font I like and indexed so I can create ""cookbook"" that one can use to find recipes by name and type.  I will not use this rather tedious program that does not do what I want it to. This software was money wasted on my part.",I am disappointed,False,1359676800,0.0,0.0

"I picked up this product as a replacement for Norton when they committed the cardinal AV sin - shutting down all antivirus services when the supbscription ended and then asking for an exorbitant re-up fee. Sadly, life isn't much better now.  There are a few key issues that you MUST be aware of:

1.  User Experience - configuration is cumbersome, complicated and incomplete (some alerts you can disable - others not, some tasks you can schedule others not).  I've been working on computers professionally since '94 and this UI is years behind the competition.

2.  Resource Usage - Since installing my system has slowed down significantly and I constantly receive connection failure errors when browsing the web - Hotmail attachments take 3 attempts to load.  And I'm running a dual core with 2 GB of RAM.

To give you an idea of how much I value Garden Organizer, I bought a copy of VMware Fusion for no other reason than to enable me to run Garden Organizer in a PC window on my Mac.  What I like most is that I can completely customize it for my garden plants.  I have kept track of hundreds of species over the years, entering all the data that I want to track in categories that I have specified myself.

For example, my categories include the date when I bought the plant, the seller from whom I bought it, how it is responding to various treatments as well as the social and botanical notes like the medicinal uses of the plant or other interesting characteristics.  Many plants don't do very well in the crazy climate of Miami where I live.  I keep track of which ones cannot tolerate our humid summers or dry winters so that I don't buy them again.  I'm also interested in the family connections--the place of each plant in the botanical world--so I have ""Family"", ""Genus"" and ""species"" as three of my categories. And I have lots of photography--my own--of flowers, leaves and fruit for each plant.

The last thing I want in my garden plant organizer is a data base of thousands of plants that I don't own.  If I want to know how to lay out a garden, or look up characteristics of common garden plants, or learn how to prune a shrub I'll buy a CD Rom.

"McAfee Total Protection with Site Advisor Plus provides a lot of value to home PC users. At an affordable cost, you can protect and manage up to 3 PCs with an impressive array of preventative maintenance and network administration tools. Importantly, you gain the peace of mind knowing that the software you are using is from McAfee, who for years has been recognized as a leader in security software solutions for business.

There are 12 main components to the product. These include software to help stop viruses, hackers, spyware and junk email. System administration tools include maintenance, file backup and restoration as well as tools for network configuration, file sharing and printing. Using an Internet connection, the software is continuously refreshed with updates so that you are protected from the latest threats.

I especially like the Site Advisor Plus feature which allows you to add a button to your browser's toolbar. When visiting a website, you can easily obtain a detailed status report of the site. The report includes an analysis of download tests for adware, spyware and other potential troublesome software; the number of emails you might expect to receive per month if you opt-in to a mail list; annoyances such as excessive use of popups; a schematic displaying the online affiliations of the site; and reviewer comments about the site. This nifty tool is immensely valuable when visiting a website for the first time and deciding how you might want to interact with the site, if at all.

The installation process was easy using a PC running MS Vista. I have since used McAfee to automate the process of backing up files to an external drive; the security updates are downloading automatically; and I frequently tuen to the Site Advisor tool for insight. In my opinion, the availability of these essential services in an easy-to-use package can save any home computer user the time and hassle of system maintenance, and consequently improve the home PC ownership experience.

Having just switch from PC editing to MAC, here is my opinion of FCE:  FCE is ok and would probably be great for most home photo and video enthusiast. Editing itself is good and has a fair to good amount of in application transitions, effects and editing abilities. For home slideshows and video editing it should work great.  I have a P/T professional business doing Photography and Videography.  My main problem is video; I have a prosumer Canon handheld and Panasonic professional video cameras, both format in MTS HD which FCE does not have the codec's. This means another step in processing.  First I tried what was suggested using imovie to create then load into FCE. I still had to convert the MTS to another format.  I bought a third party program to convert the MTS HD into another HD MPG4 or apple format. Very cumbersome and time consuming with having to convert and then the fact that FCE has to render before editing.  I also had to re-load several times to even get my video to load correctly [this is possible my inexperience with FCE].  I'm not use to rendering before authoring.  Still have problems in FCE accepting all of the clips.  Took my MAC book Pro to apple on a One-to-One and went over difficulties I'm having.  The tech was very helpful, but application would still be too cumbersome and to time consuming for keeping production costs within a practical budget.  I have ending up ordering FC Suite which is suppose to have the codec's in the application and not limited in all other areas.  I have been using Adobe and other PC based Editing software.

"Just a clarification for all reviewers/readers based upon some inaccurate posts..

Parallels is not an emulator, it is a virtualization supervisor running under OS X. Some folks incorrectly call Parallels a hypervisor, but a hypervisor actually runs below any guest operating systems, such as OS X or Windows. Virtualization provides a layer of abstraction between the hardware and the guest operating systems, but the operating system still leverages the native instruction set of the CPU (in this case, Intel CPU) to perform its work. Emulation would involve a translation from one CPU instruction set to another, such is the case with Intel emulation running on a PowerPC CPU (running OS X), where the emulator provides a ""faked"" Intel environment for a guest operating system, where every Intel instruction must be converted to PowerPC for execution. There's a big difference between emulation and virtualization -- Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion are both virtualization supervisors, not emulators as this reviewer states.

Parallels is a great product with very tight Mac/OS X integration.  For the average user, it is probably a slightly better choice than VMware Fusion given a tighter integration with OS X.  However, Fusion is more efficient (but less flexible), and that may make a difference for gamers that tax their systems to the limit from a performance perspective.  If you are not a gamer and are simply looking for OS X and Windows to co-exist, Parallels is going to be a better choice (today -- EMC/VMware is not going to take a beating sitting down, and they have more Intel virtualization experience than any company on the planet, even though mainframe virtualization was invented by IBM in the late '60's).",Virtualization vs. Emulation,False,1195948800,2.19722457733622,1.0

It's unbelievably slow to accept transactions, reconcile the accounts, and similar tasks.  What used to take me 1 second for the click now takes my 7 seconds for the same click.

There are only minor cosmetic changes to the program from what I've seen.  Is it worth upgrading?  Probably not (unless you have 2012 or older and Windows 8.x).  Is it worth the price?  Definitely not.  It would have been nice to see product information on Intuit's website BEFORE this went on sale, and to have the option to purchase an upgrade instead of the full product (again).  Apparently, Intuit does not believe in upgrades.

Additional review: The more I use Quicken 2014, the more I miss Microsoft Money!!  This is definitely not worth the money I spent.  It crashed 6 times while trying to reconcile my accounts over the last 2 hours.  COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!!!  It has messed up the payment amounts for several of my bill reminders (including calculated loans) so now I have to spend additional time to fix those.  If I could give this a -1 star, I would at this point.

"I've had Macs since they first came out. I'm not an expert but do enjoy the Mac system. As the hard drives get larger and the range of use expanding on all computers, there are going to be maintenance issues. I'm a home movie guy and have huge movie files which means lots of data to maintain. Techtool 5 works great on my iMac 24"", 2.4 Hz, running latest operating system 10.6.6. I have never used e partition (creating an E drive) successfully but maybe because there is a better way. On a Mac you can't clean up your main drive from running TechTool Pro 5 on the drive. Instead, partition your main drive into volume 1 and 2 with 2 being smaller. Put a new OS on volume two and then load Techtool Pro 5 onto the 2nd volume. When you are using your main volume (#1) and have some OS issues, shut down volume 1 and start up in volume 2. From #2 clean up volume #1. This works much quicker than inserting Techtool disc into computer. It takes a long time to use the disk to clean up your main drive . . . but it will do it.

Techtool Pro 5 does about 99% of all needed clean up. It'll also do the defragmentation, some recovery, etc. But the ""clean up"" maintenance is a routine thing everyone needs to do . . . like changing the oil in your car. Its sort of the same thing. Do it and life is better.

And if you don't want to partition your main drive, get an external drive and put an OS on it, and download from disc the Techtool Pro 5 program. You'll have same advantage . . . just costs more, for the drive, and its one more device to maintain (wires, power supply, etc).

Good luck. Enjoy your Mac! A great machine . . . not perfect but not bad. Get Techtool Pro 5!! (No I don't work for Techtool Pro 5 or have anything to do with them. It's just a good product.)",Techtool 5 Works Great!!!,False,1297036800,0.0,1.0

"A couple of years ago, I was going to France, so I bought ""Learn to Speak French Deluxe"" By the Learning Company.  After 8-9 hours, I felt like I could perform basic tasks in French, like ordering, asking direction, checking into a hotel, buying a train ticket...

Now, I'm headed to Italy, so I looked for a comparable product, but unfortunately, there is no ""Learn to Speak Italian"".  I found Tell Me More Italian and it seemed to be the best option.

First of all, it cost about 5x what my very effective French software had cost.  Then, when I installed it and tried it out, I found it to be very complicated, much more so than necessary, and WAY over my head in terms of helping me to learn anything.  I started with the ""Beginning"" level, only to find dialog, drills, videos entirely in Italian with no explanation.  Here's an example... the VERY FIRST lesson asks you to respond appropriately to phrases spoken in a dialog.  So, the reader says something in Italian and there are a handful of choices all in Italian and I'm supposed to pick an appropriate one.  I don't even know what the reader just said, let alone what the responses mean.  There is no translation, no explanation.

When I was considering buying this product, I did a lot of research.  I found many, many reviews that complained that it threw you too quickly into the Italian with no explanation.  I thought to myself that those people were just wimps that didn't understand that you don't learn a language by memorizing vocabulary.  I already speak Spanish fluently, so I figured, ""Oh, yeah, I can hanle it""... boy was I wrong.  I should have headed the warnings.

"I love taking pictures with my digital camera and enjoy sharing them with family and friends. Paintshop ProX5 allows me to organize and edit my pictures as well as to share them with family and friends.

It is important for me to have an easy to use photo editing software.  This software is easy enough for someone like me to use but has features that an advanced user would enjoy.

There are three tabs at the top of the screen that help a person use the software.  The tabs are manage, adjust and edit.

The manage tab deals with organizing photos, identifying them and rating them.  The adjust tab allows you to use a lot of different features to adjust the sharpness, tone, brightness and contrast of a picture. The edit tab allows you to edit photos in more ways than I care to list.  There is an adjust option in the edit tab that allows a person to use many of the features in the adjust tab.

I have yet to use the adjust and edit features completely but I could see a professional being able to do very complicated tasks. The help menu is great and there are ways to do quick fixes which allow the software to fix up a picture for you.  I have had this software for a couple of months and am still learning all that I can do.

Last year this happened; through a Quicken support group I found I needed to uninstall and reinstall the program to get rid of a faulty patch issued by Intuit.

It downloaded it directly, without me having to go to the site on my own. I did need to have the access code, but it was easy to cut-and-paste from the Amazon site.

From the time of purchase to the point where the program was downloaded took less than 10 minutes. Once it was downloaded, I had to register with Kaspersky, but that was fairly straight-forward.

"Final Update - On February 1, 2011, I went to the Autodesk website to check for additional updates and found that FreeStyle had been withdrawn from sale.  Customer support stopped April 1, 2011.

Update 10/7/2010 - The first product update was released a couple of weeks ago. The major change fixes the first item below...you can now create custom symbols and store them in the library.  I'm still in the process of evaluating the release and will update this note after I've used it a bit more.

Original Review:
The designers of a package like AutoCAD FreeStyle face a classic challenge: It needs to be easy to use for a novice, with enough features to be useful, yet not so powerful that it will cannibalize sales of the high-end (and much more expensive) AutoCAD systems.  After spending a couple of days using AutoCAD FreeStyle, I think the designers set the bar way too low.  The interface is simple and easy to learn, but far too many features are missing for FreeStyle to be a competitive program.  That's not to say that FreeStyle can't be used to produce usable drawings; it just could be much better if it included basic features that are in other systems.  Let me go through some of the areas that stood out...

Symbol Library - A library is a collection of symbols that are created once and then used on multiple drawings.  FreeStyle comes with a collection of prebuilt symbols that are sufficient to get started, however it's not a complete enough library for a lot of projects - when I attempted to draw my sprinkler system, I discovered that there are no sprinkler components listed.  In most CAD systems, this problem is addressed by allowing the user to build custom symbols.  Once they're added to the library, they can be repeatedly used in future drawings.  This release of FreeStyle doesn't have that capability.  The symbols that come with the program are all that you've got, and that simply isn't enough.  Incidentally, what's in the library is even a little strange... the Electrical Symbols tab includes five Gas and Water symbols along with the basic electrical symbols and the Building Components section only contains six fireplace facades...I'm sure that in real life there are more building components than just those.

Paper Size and Scale - When you start a new drawing, the program asks you to select the size of the paper and the object that you' re going to draw.  e.g. you pick 8.5 x 11"" paper and select that the page represents a 30' x 40' space.  The scale shows that "" equals 1'.  This makes perfect sense to anybody not used to using a CAD program, but is backwards from the norm...normally a designer would select a paper size and a scale.

Splines - Splines are a way of smoothly connecting a series of points.  By adjusting the ""handles"", you can easily draw complex curves.  FreeStyle doesn't have a way of drawing with splines.  The menu allows you to draw with arc segments, straight lines and freehand ""doodles"".  You can adjust the points of inflection on the doodle and eventually get to the desired curve, but it's not as easy as it seems.  True spline capability would be easier.

Radius line joins - When drawing a floor plan, most lines meet with a sharp corner, but that's not always the case.  Sometimes a drawing needs to have a rounded curve joining the two lines.  Most 2-D drafting systems can do that automatically, but FreeStyle lacks that capability.  You can manually accomplish the same thing by drawing a small arc, but why?  You're only talking about a millisecond of computer time to have the program do it for you.

Double lines for walls - Often walls in architectural drawings are shown by two parallel lines, representing the inside and outside surfaces.  Freestyle doesn't have that ability built-in.  To do it correctly, it's a little more complicated that just having a double line as a selectable line type....you need to specify wall thickness, join corners correctly and scale appropriately as the drawing size changes.  Again, all this can be done manually, but the basic idea is to have the program save time by doing the work for you.  Incidentally, the work around is to simply draw a thick solid line for walls...look at all the sample drawings for examples.

Draw a wall of a house.  Now drag a window or door from the symbol library and place it onto the wall.  You'd think that the wall would break and allow the object to be inserted.  It doesn't.  OK, now manually break the wall into two separate line segments and drag the line ends apart to create the necessary break.  That would work, if there was a way to break a line into two pieces, but there isn't.  So you nuke the whole side of the house and redraw two separate line segments on either side of the door.  That works...until you realize that the door is 6"" to the left of where it should be.

The algorithm that calculates color fills is flaky.  When you drag the fill icon over a fillable area, the area is highlighted with a light version of the fill color. It's a nice idea, so you can see exactly where the color's going.  Unfortunately, a single open pixel prevents an area from filling.  The highlighting, though, isn't nearly so discerning.  It's not unusual to have an area highlight, but fail to fill when clicking on the mouse button.  I also managed to fill in an object and then select the color and move it while leaving the outline behind...it was a little strange.

There's no instruction manual.  You can get help for any of the commands by selecting that command and clicking the question mark icon.  Clicking on the icon showing three stacked baby letter blocks takes you to the Freestyle website where there is more detailed information.  It's annoying, though, not to have something you can skim through.  I was trying to figure out how to color in a tree and it wasn't until I saw a picture in the on-line help that I realized that the color was coming from a filled in circle located behind the tree.

I could add more, but you get the idea.  If the product manager at AutoDesk chooses, all of these can (and should) be fixed in a future release.  Until then, though, I'm only giving FreeStyle two stars.  The simple user interface is right on the mark for a non-technical consumer level product.  The omitted features, though, cost it dearly in the ability to produce usable and functional drawings.",Not quite ready for prime time...and now it never will be,False,1277337600,3.8712010109078916,0.0

"I had purchased an earlier version of this Dragon several years ago. Even after spending a lot of time trying to train the program, I found that it did not work well enough to be usable. But I decided to take the plunge again, and I am happy that I did. Speaking Naturally 10 is impressive. With a minimal amount of setup, the program does a great job at accurately capturing what I say. Sure, it makes a few errors on more unusual words, but they have made the correction process so easy that fixing the mistake hardly takes any effort at all.

I find that I use it for creating rough drafts, and then go back to edit them the old fashioned way. The program has an excellent capability for editing, and I can certainly see that if typing were not possible (for health or some other reason), I could learn to do the entire job without a keyboard. But right now the hybrid approach seems to work best for me. However, I have a feeling that, over time, I will use voice editing more and more, and go to the keyboard less and less.

I was quite impressed with the program's ability to handle long phrases, and complete sentences. So you can dictate in a way that is most comfortable for you. If you decide you don't like what you just said, you simply say ""Scratch That"" and you get to say it again. This is a lot easier than deleting whole sentences with the keyboard or mouse after you decide to put the phrase a different way. If you want to search the document for a certain word - for example: Amazon, you simply say: Select Amazon and you find yourself with the word Amazon selected. I found this much easier that using the Edit Find commands.

You can also use voice commands to interact with the application. I spent a little time trying to use it to navigate around a web site, and found it more cumbersome that using the keyboard. But again, if circumstances are such that a keyboard is not feasible, then I believe the voice command approach would also be workable with a little practice.

Another cool thing is how the dictation works even in the presence of background noise. I have a noisy airconditioner right behind my desk, and yet I do not notice any degradation in the recognition quality when the air conditioner is turned on.

"I have been a long time Zone Alarm Pro user.  Advocated it for all my friends, but the latest version was problematic.  Our kids PC keeps getting infected despite using a non Admin/non Power User account for him and requiring a password to confirm changes in Zone Alarm.  So after my own notebook started to head south a month ago in terms of responsiveness I decided to load the TIS Pro 2008 trial.  I have been very happy.

I like the update process, it is better than Zone Alarm's method.  I like the scanning, it doesn't use up the entire CPU.  I am still trying to figure out the best way to setup my MFCs.  The Belkin Network USB works with it once I added it's utility to the list of allowed and opened the correct ports.  It hosts a Epson MFC (9400-Fax) which works flawlessly. I am still trying to figure out (not very much time spent) on getting my Brother MFC-5840CN to scan across the network to this machine.  Printing works fine to it.  Just a matter I believe of doing the same thing as I did for the hub/epson by adding the correct programs (there are 5 I believe that machine uses) and ports to the allowed programs/ports lists.  Although I miss the program style control of Zone Alarm Pro, I think I like the TIS Pro model better.

Our kids notebook is crawling again (it has Zone Alarm Pro on it), I suspect once again it has been infected.  Looks like we will be using the recovery disk on that PC then loading TIS Pro 08 onto it.  My trial expires in four days, and I am buying this today.  I still have over a 100 days before my Zone Alarm subscription runs out.  I wish I had put the trial on the kids PC as well, but then I might not have had such an obvious way to compare the two.

"I buy Encarta every year, and Britannica from time to time. This is my opinion:
TEXT: Britannica's writing style is more sophisticated, and its authors are very well known.  However, Encarta is not bad written at all, its authors are good and the contents are more or less the same, or better in the last versions.
You can update Britannica over the Internet free for a year, but only quarterly (4 times).  Encarta is updated EVERY WEEK with new articles and additions to the old ones.
MULTIMEDIA and FEATURES:  Encarta devastates Britannica with a lot of animations, interactivities, videos, music and sounds, pictures, literature sidebars, new translation dictionaries, Atlas, 2 D and 3 D virtual tours, timeline, games ...  It's not only the quantity and quality. It is the easy access you have to all the multimedia, and that text, multimedia and features are completely integrated.
NAVIGATING:  Encarta wins again. You only have to type a phrase, a word or de beginning of a word to see all the articles and multimedia that contains it.  If you have typed the name of a small village lost in Senegal (e.g.), you see it in the Atlas without clicking again.  If Encarta does not find anything, it gives you alternative spellings and you meet with what was looking for.  To go ""jumping"" from article to article is very easy and quick, because you have a lot of links and the ""Related Articles"" section.  If you need to copy text or pictures, the integration with Microsoft's WORD is perfect.
Navigating with Britannica is different. You do not get crazy, but ...  I only say that, if you do not know the exact and correct spelling of a name or word, it does not help you with alternative or similar spellings.
My computer is Pentium III 1000 Mhz 256 RAM, and I have copied Britannica into the hard drive (the same with Encarta). The fact is that it is very slow, and that takes a lot of RAM (50 % more or less).  If you have other programs open, perhaps Britannica does not work.  With Encarta, you do not have any problem.

"This is my second Hallmark Card Studio.
The good points: you can easily take their pre-made card and change the fonts - color, style, & size - or make one of your own from scratch. Most of the time you can change the headings like for Aunt rather Grandmother. You can add your own photos. If you like the verse but not the illustrations, erase it and put your own.

The cons: I think the artists must have been out of the United States. It has ONE African-American person, and that's a cartoon but 7 African people. Middle East - 8 cartoons, Irish - only shamrocks. British - 3 pictures with stones. Priest - 3 cartoons - one of them is a frog! Wedding - none in current styles - and about half of them are mice! Wedding dress - no beautiful flowing gowns.

"As a beta tester for Quicken 2011 I've had a couple months to really dive into the features of Quicken Deluxe 2011 and have been using it as my primary Personal Finance Software. The last version of Quicken I used was Quicken Deluxe 2008 after upgrading yearly since 2005. Prior to that I was a MS Money users since Money 97, upgrading every other version.
When I switched from Money to Quicken I felt that I gave up some nice user experiences and fluidity of the application. Money was getting a little too friendly with butterflies and cartoony icons. Quicken on the other hand felt very old school, pretty rigid and sorta ugly. But I felt it was more robust and learned to work in the clunkier UI.
Quicken 2011 has gone a long way toward improving the user experience while maintaining the robust feature set. The influence of the Mint team is immediate obvious on the default home page with a drill-down spending pie chart that is taken directly form the Mint site. This is a good feature for quickly seeing where your money has gone. The ability to click down into sub-categories and then payees is very nice. It's also helpful to catch if you've miscategorized a transaction. Below that on the home screen is the upcoming bills/reminders so you have a clear view (after entering the reminders) of where your money is going to go. You can enter/skip this bills from that home page without going to another screen or register. At the bottom of the home page is a customizable spending tracker. I took advantage of the customization and removed this completely.
These home page features and their logical, easy links to Spending and Bills tabs lay out a good workflow for managing your day-to-day finances. Unfortunately, as you move further across the tabs you get to the Planning tab with the Spending Planner, Lifetime Planner and Tax Center. The latter two don't appear to have been touched since the 2008 versions but the Spending Planner is promoted from the My Savings Plan to front and center for planning purposes. I cannot figure out how this is supposed to work and be better than the budget tool in Quicken. And many beta testers had this same experience. The Spending Planner really falls short of being useful and I ignore it completely. Intuit could really benefit its users by including some video tutorials about how this feature is supposed to work and the philosophy behind it (the Help files are as cryptic as the feature). Ultimately, I would prefer that Quicken have it's budget feature better integrated to the Planning tab and not contained in a separate modal box. The budget tool appears to not have been updated since I started using Quicken in 2005 - and it is really one of the key tools I use consistently.
Overall, the at-a-glance and easy drill down of the home page, Spending and Bills tab make for a good upgrade from downlevel versions. If you are using Quicken 2010 you may not see real compelling need to upgrade, but for 2008 and earlier users, this is an upgrade you should really consider.",A Good Upgrade from Downlevel Versions,False,1286409600,5.8888779583328805,1.0

"As a user of Quickbooks 2007 and 2009 after it, I was looking forward to trying out the latest and greatest version to resolve some nagging issues that I had with the 2009 version (some of which were carry-overs from 2007 that I figured would be fixed in 2009) and gain much-needed compatibility with Windows 7.

Most importantly, I wanted to have complete compatibility with Windows 7 (64 bit). While QB2009 worked for the most part, it was not able to generate PDF files and it was a little fussy about applying updates without running in Administrator mode. Generating PDF's is how I generate invoices and send them out by E-Mail, so this is an important feature for me.

On that point, I was very happy when QB2010 installed on both Windows 7 RC and the release version successfully. Unfortunately, a subsequent update caused PDF generation to fail. This update (R5) was done by Intuit on December 29, 2009, and nearly 3 months later, it has not been fixed. Fortunately, there is documentation in Intuit's support site about a workaround that is successful.

For them to break functionality and then not fix it after more than two months is inappropriate, and it calls into question what they might break in future revision updates. I will definitely think twice when any new updates are flagged and check around before applying them.

Aside from that, how does Quickbooks 2010 work?

Sadly, some nagging interface issues have existed in Quickbooks since at least the 2007 version and the company shows no sign of improving them.

For example, the process of entering billable time is very clunky. The fields do not default to a preset value, or even the last value entered. For a sole proprietor, there is never a need to enter a different person for whom time record applies. Rather than default to the only employee name present in the Employees list, the drop-down insists on looking through all of the ""Other Names"" for possible matches. My name is listed above the ""other names"" but as I type, it ignores my name at the top of the list and shows the first match to the letters typed until enough of my name has been typed to exclude all other possibilities. A small issue, sure, but aggravating nonetheless.

As a long-time Quicken user, my first impression of Quickbooks 2007 was that it was years behind Quicken 2006 in interface design. Dialogs look like they were designed when Windows 3.1 was all the rage. Being a business tool, I don't need or want animated clip art or unnecessary visual elements, but isn't it possible to introduce user interface elements that would make the dialogs more visually effective and maybe even a little more appealing?

In addition to a visual design that looks very dated, there are interface elements that are not suitably-sized for their contents. An example of this is in the ""Make Deposits"" dialog. The ""Deposit to"" drop-down box is so small that the names of the accounts do not fit. This makes it difficult to distinguish between accounts that may have similar beginnings with account numbers at the end. This forces me to change how I do things instead of the software adapting to my needs. The dialog has plenty of horizontal space, so expanding that field would not be a problem. The program is littered with examples like this, and I will not belabor the point by providing more examples.

The time it takes Quickbooks to start and load a company file got longer from 2009 to 2010 as well. I'm not able to time-test between them, but the startup time is excruciating (~30-45 seconds), and it prevents me from being able to pop into the program, do a little data entry and get back out again and return to other tasks.

Should a Quickbooks 2009 user upgrade?

At this point, I would say no. Unless you need a feature that was introduced in 2010. Since I received 2010 at the same time that Windows 7 was officially released, I don't have any experience running QB 2009 under the released version of Windows 7. It's possible that the PDF generation issues in 2009 can be fixed with the same workaround that is necessary for R5 release of 2010.

I have found no compelling features in 2010 that were not in 2009. Everyone uses this program differently, so what may be inconsequential to me may be vitally important to someone else. However, based on my usage needs, so little has changed between Quickbooks 2007 and 2010 that Intuit should be embarrassed to continue charging $150+ for each incremental upgrade they release each year.

That said, however, Quickbooks 2010 does serve my needs. I am now entrenched in the program far enough that I would not be interested in moving to a different tool unless there was a significant reason to do so. The time and effort that would take would need to be compensated by a large benefit in usability, features, and/or productivity in my workflow.

While I will check out the inevitable release of Quickbooks 2011 in the hopes that some of these issues will be addressed, they will need to impress me with what I see before I would shell out another $150 for a new version.","More compatible w/ Windows 7, but updates broke functionality.

"First off, i will be fair to say I did not purchase at Amazon, but got it from a membership store.  The worst part for me was deciding which one to buy and I wanted the one with the free ""State"" included free with it but I saw nothing big on box to state this like in the past but I found it.  Luckily, the store had it, but from what I read on Amazon, Amazon's was an added cost.  Maybe I just didn't see the one that included ""State"" on Amazon as I went by similar pricing instead of searching each one.  It was confusing and then once I bought it, I heard about forms that were missing on the Deluxe version and people had to upgrade and then Turbo Tax rectified it and well, it was a big mess for many.  Again i got lucky and did not need the forms that were missing.  This is why I gave it four stars as the Turbo Tax I purchased worked great for me but way too confusing buying it.  Turbo Tax needs to simplify the buyers experience as it has been.  I have been a Turbo Tax user since the early 90's and have relied on it.

"Here's the deal.  If you plan to make CDlabels that you will print just one time this is an ok way to get started.  The problem for me was I bought the first version of Professinoal CD Label kit by GlobalStar software.  I saved lots of CD lables for home moveis, Computer Install CD's etc.

Two major problems with the product:  first, I could not import any of my old saved labels from the first version of the program.  Second, you must buy refill paper as this program generally only works with the size of paper that ships in the kit which locks you into that and greatly limits where you can buy refill paper.  I tried creating a custom ofset to make the program work with lables other than what it shipped with.  It worked only some of the time and wasted hours doing it.

Also, you move the paper guides on your printer to fit these labels.  When you use ordinary full sized labels They are the standard 8-1/2x11"".

A much better way to go is buy a program that handles any paper then you can use just about any labels.  Staples generic ... no problem, avery, no problem.  The best program I found after many hours of searching is called: Acoustica CD DVD Label Maker.  The program is compatible with at leat 50 brands of paper!  And they will add more if you ask.  This solves the problem of what to do when the paper runs out.  Remember, once you save your cd labls on your computr you are locked in to their program and an paper refils.

"High expectations! I bought this on a lightening deal as a second learning program for studying guitar. I have electric guitars. Used it exclusively for about a week and was actually a bit disappointed. It functioned OK on my windows 10 operating system but the program itself is tedious to use after a few lessons. The included music referenced is old and royalty free. The exercises do help you learn to switch between chords quickly. The education was just about playing chords and I didn't learn much more than that. Still, it was useful a bit. The fretboard was nice. The videos were easy to use. The topic discussions were OK. The thing is that I just don't want to use it anymore so I cannot get into the program deeper to determine if there is something truly redeeming in the app. There were links included to other websites with tabs and more popular songs and those were scary links. The first link I clicked on triggered my malware blocker so I didn't use the other links.

In summary: So my review does reflect that functionally it worked. It may be useful to someone learning but it didn't appeal to me much at all. Following the included links to popular music are not recommended. It needs a serious upgrade to include some popular music that people can relate to with tonal memories to help them learn rhythm. But I cannot recommend this software overall. If it helps, I am a 50 year old learning guitar for the first time. I actually prefer Rocksmith (PS4) and some apps on the ipad over this software. Don't usually like to reference other software in my reviews because it might make people think I represent the other supplier.

"This warning is for users who already have Nero 6: The installation of Nero 7 ""Enhanced"" requires the complete removal of N6.  There is an automated uninstall tool that rears its ugly head when you initialize the N7 install process. THIS UNINSTALL PROCEDURE IS HIGHLY FLAWED AND CAN DAMAGE YOUR PC'S BOOT PROCESSES.

Here's what happened to me: Before inserting the N7 install CD, I created an Windows Restore point, then loaded the disc. The N7 installer found the pre-existing N6 files and stated that de-installation of all Nero components was required before N7 installation, so (BIG MISTAKE), I proceeded.  It un-installed all existing Nero components in sequence, then requested a reboot before N7 installation.

Upon reboot, XP could get as far as the desktop image and then locked up.  No applications loaded in the Systems Tray and the Start button was inoperable.  Subsequent reboot attempts also failed.

N7 comes with a flyer offering a measly 10-day free tech-support.  However, in my situation, this presented me with a nasty Catch-22: To call the line, you must first register a provided ""TSID number"" over the 'net.  Well, gee, I couldn't do that since my PC wouldn't boot, but I called anyway.  Of course, when the tech guy comes on the phone, he sounds totally surprised, like no one else has ever had this problem, but I demanded he assist anyway.

He gets off the phone, comes back on, and tells me to reboot into Safe Mode.  I try it, but I can't even get that far; it just hangs uncompleted, too.  He does the  off-on phone routine again, and inanely tells me to try it again.  However, I opt for the ""last known good config mode"" option on my own.  It works, and the Windows desktop successfully loads.

I hang up, go thru the Windows Restore process, and test the restored N6.  It seems to be functioning as it was prior to this debacle.  And that's where I'm getting off the bus on the Nero upgrade route.

In retrospect, perhaps I should have stopped the process  when N7 prompted the N6 de-install, and used the Windows Add/Remove tool to accomplish that task.

After reading this, if you're still crazy enough to attempt an N7 install, you should consider that option.  I'll never know, because my N7 package is going in the garbage: If they couldn't even get something as basic as the upgrade installation  procedure right, who knows what else, equally non-trivial & dangerous, lurks in the product after it's loaded?

I strongly suspect that competitive pressures between Nero and Roxio (whose own Media Creator 9 has also been widely vilified) are forcing releases of bug-laden, unthoroughly-tested versions of their mutual flagship products.  Unfortunately, this is the same principle that has left the Big Three Detroit automakers in their present precarious financial positions: They, too, fostered off R&D projects as finished products, that had to be continually repaired from the day they hit the road, on unsuspecting consumers for years and are now paying the price.

As the Big Three have discovered, and as Roxio & Nero probably will also soon experience, consumers have other places to go to get well-built/tested products.

I purchased the state on line but it did not install (an updater did but without the program you just got an error message) yet I received 3 e-mails charging me $39.95 each (a different  confirmation code on each e-mail sent 5 minutes apart from each other).  I called about that matter and finally was told that the 2 additional charges would be refunded.

"I have been a huge fan of QuickBooks since I first put an employer's books on them back in 1997 or so.  The only quirk was that it was just as cheap to buy the upgrade every year, as it was to purchase the ""payroll tax table updates"" from Intuit.

Apparently, with QuickBooks 2006, they have circumvented this necessity by requiring you to purchase a $199/year add-on if you want to process payroll through QuickBooks.  I called the Sales line, and the operator was quick to tell me that I could *manually* do the payroll by calculating FICA, SUTA, FUTA, Fed w/h, and state w/h separately, and then manually entering all these numbers into the paycheck and having QuickBooks print it.  I believe that this unnecessarily complicates the process -- especially for those business owners that may only have a few employees.

I am very disappointed with Intuit for making these changes.  I think that this greatly devalues their product.  I would give it 5 stars if you are not processing payroll, but NO stars for the payroll issue.

"I have been using PSP since the days when it was free. I was finally forced to give up my beloved PSP8 version when I moved to Win7 64-bit. Though I actually purchased this version from Corel, my experience with this product and the company has been so negative I felt others should know. For 2 days now I have experienced repeated failures in getting this software to install and run. (I have a high level of knowledge and experience, going back to the Commodore Vic 20) I have tried many different installation methods, including those suggested by Corel. Perhaps more frustrating than the software is the horrible experience I have had with the company. In spite of having paid for the product, received a serial number, and gone through the web site registration process, I am forbidden access to the website for any sort of communication, even to post in the forums or send a contact e-mail. Only registered users are allowed the privilege, and though I'm registered...I'm not. The only recourse was to wait out a long distance phone call for 40 minutes in order to reach support (which, so far, has been useless). You're allowed one free call BTW. Each one after that costs $20! At this point I feel like some criminal organization has bilked me out of $60 and left me to flounder. I could install and open X4 once. Then, each time I closed and re-opened it, it would refuse to run, bringing up the same error about my copy having been damaged or illegally installed. I was able to get a taste of the program during these brief snippets. Sadly, what used to be a relatively simple-to-use and very capable program now suffers from bloat and an overabundance of ""features."" Gone is the simple, clean interface of past versions, which allowed one to do a day's work without encumbrance and confusion. The work area is now fractured into a complex of separate panes, a virtual rip-off of Microsoft's Expression Web. New and experienced users alike will spend lots of time trying to locate a simple function. Functionality is also hindered by an almost unusable gray color scheme, someone's idea of dee-zign (already bearing an onslaught of user complaints). Worst of all, the former re-sizable browser window with its variable thumbnail array, where the bulk of the management chores took place, has been replaced by a scrollable horizontal banner that runs across the bottom of the work area. A limited number of thumbnails can be displayed here at one time (even on a wide-screen monitor), leaving one to constantly scroll back-and-forth to view bits and pieces of the thumbnail library. It apparently can be expanded vertically, at the expense of squeezing all other panels into the top of the screen, but gone is the ability to view and manage a large array of thumbnails at a glance. In short, my brief experience demonstrated that the old, easy-to-use PSP, which offered pros and semi-pros, like me, A wide array of effective tools in a relatively clean and useable interface, is gone. Corel now offers a program crammed with salable ""features"" few will ever understand (or use), and has eliminated a very functional work-a-day interface, replacing it with one who's main features seem to be confusion, complexity, and eye-candy. Tragically, for Win 7 users there is no viable competition without moving into very expensive territory. Who knows, if I could just get it to install and run, I might find it workable in spite of its bugs and unbelievably awful interface.

Addendum: I was able to turn up clues that X4, unfortunately, employs DRM protection(!), and recognized that my installation failures were probably related. After 2-3 hours online with a very nice Corel tech assistant, the infernal DRM software defeated any and all attempts to allow us to get X4 running. Corel finally had to resort to allowing me to download a disk image and try running from that. After three days of efforts, X4 is up and running. I thank Cameron for the informative tip, which reminds me this program is going to require some relearning. Still, I feel that a program that used to allow all functions from a single screen, and now requires mousing back-and-forth between three different interfaces to get the same things accomplished, is not progress.

"I used this product since 1988 (DOS, 5.25"" floppies), and wouldn't want to give it up.  I've been buying it through my FI which has a partnership discount rather than from a re-seller like Amazon.com & Costco.  Right now, what you get is a TurboTax ""shell"" to transfer last year's ""info data"" to the current year, and forms which act as placeholders until finalized forms are released by the IRS.  The State forms are preliminary and incomplete, and they are last to be released by TurboTax, because typically, State tax codes are based off of what the Feds do.  Also, at this time, W-2's, 1099's, 1098's, etc. haven't been released, and although you can backfill them from all your 12/31/2012 statements, it reduces the ease you are trying to achieve.  Also, wait until your IRS report forms are received, then do an online software update.

TurboTax evolved to a Q&A type format which remains the user interface for the past decade or so, grouping similar topics together like ""Income"", ""Deductions"", ""Taxes Paid"", etc.  I think it reflects how many taxpayers think about the topics.

Previously, users have complained about the cost of State efile, and pricing structure.  I haven't studied the 2012 structure, but here are the usual suspects:

(1) State efile fee of $20  --  I just send in the paper and avoid the fee (3-4 weeks to receive a state refund).  Not really Turbotax's issue as the states should get together and perhaps adopt a common platform which Turbotax & HR Block acn just charge a nominal fee for any state rather than the (2011) $20 to file.
(2) My complaint is the ""up sell"" needed to do stock/securities sales --  previously, it seems the ""Deluxe"" was adequate for typical mutual fund or occassional broker transactions, but the TurboTax's ""guide"" points me to the ""Premier"" edition to do something that is common to many households  --  kind of like paying for ""premium"" airfare ticket to use the toilet (not everyone will use the on-board toilet, but come on, don't price it to be an extra).
Admittedly, while there appears to be rising SRP, the actual price paid seems to be just inflation indexed, rather than real increases (unlike my cable & cell phone bills) -- I'm skeptical about the ""more features for the same money"" explanation.
(3) Historically, price for the 2nd State was somewhat exhorbitant (is it still $40 ? used to be $20) - -  I needed it for several years because of relocations and cross-state situations (NY-NJ-CT is common, maybe DC-MD-VA.  TurboTax says it's competitive, I say it's the last gas station for 100 miles so better buy it at whatever they charge.

In the past, I have had several issues with TurboTax, and because I now look for them, it is hard for me to determine if they still persist, or TurboTax has solved them.

(1) Previously, the NY State software would default to Itemized Deduction if I Itemized for Fed filing --  in NY, often STANDARD Deduction is better than the adjusted Itemized Deduction (State taxes are not deductible for State returns, and for many renters, Standard would be better).  The State software was too dumb to do a comparison between the two.  I had to do an overide for several years but now don't live in NY anymore (NOTE: your state may require the same deduction election).
(2) I now file Form SE, and the first time using it, it would populate numbers that were VERY difficult to determine the source. It required a lot of cross checking to determine where the numbers were coming from.  It seems the Interface now has a specific question employment by International Organizations which don't have payroll deduction.
(3) In California (during 2003-09), TurboTax would not apply capital loss carry-forward to state taxes, and I paid state taxes on capital gains w/o offset from carryover capital losses.  I overpaid several hundred $ of Calif taxes, and when I became aware, was able to file an amended return (see below).  (Odd since Intuit's HQ is in Mountain View, Calif.)
(4) Compared to versions from years ago, the software has have much less ""data source"" documentation.  In the older versions, you could click on a field and it would send you to the field, form or info page where the data / number was transferred from.  Now, you get a vague entry that doesn't help to quality-assure the various numbers.

The Amend Return function for states is now much easier  --  I needed to use it for 3 consecutive years in arrears because of Turbotax sofware bugs.  Beginning around 2008, the software was able to provide (for states) a function that allowed more automation to the process.

I applaud TurboTax's ""User Account"" approach for online purchasers whereby you can download the software for at least 3 years.  When I filed amended returns, I had a different PC and was able to download the software to use.  I don't know about CD purchasers from re-sellers though.

Overall, it is still very good software, but you need to do manual tracing on the State return to validate, particularly if you have special situations which reduce your taxes.",Indispensable Tool --  Simplifies a Complex Annual Task,False,1357776000,3.555348061489413,1.0

"I've been using Windows 7 since its beta release, but my laptop's been running the final version for weeks now. I really disliked Vista and preferred XP still, but Windows 7 has tipped the scales...finally. Windows 7 has been reliable and it's snappier than Vista.  Windows 7 sips laptop battery power so my 1-year-old Dell XPS M1530 runs longer under Win7 than it did under Vista.  But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers. Here's a list of my favorites:

#1 VIRTUAL LIBRARIES
With virtual libraries, the special folders like Documents, Pictures, Music and Videos have all become libraries. Instead of being a physical storage location, they're indexes that point to one or many locations on the computer you're using, as well as other computers you're networked with. In a home setting, where you're running Windows Home Server, you can now easily direct file stores to your server.  Also in the home, housemates can easily see each others' data by including their respective folders in one another's libraries. When you search a library, you're searching your computer and any other computer that has folders you've added to your library.  You determine which physical location will be the default location for saving new files to your library.  This is, for me, the single best feature of Windows 7, and is an excellent reason to upgrade.

#2 START SEARCH
The Start Search has been improved in Windows 7 so results appear instantly as soon as you click the Start button, and then either type the name of a program on your computer, or a task you'd like to perform (like, ""change my display settings""). No more hunting folder hierarchies to find that elusive program, or spend time figuring out where Microsoft has placed something in the Control Panel. This is a tremendous time-saver.

#3 AERO SNAP
The Aero user interface has three new tricks -- Shake, Peek, and Snap -- but only Aero Snap is a major leap forward. Have you ever tried comparing the contents of two windows together, side-by-side? It's painful to do because you have to fiddle with resizing the two windows. With Aero Snap, now all you do is grab the title bar of one window, sling it to the left, and Windows 7 will automatically resize the window to fill-up one-half of your screen display. Do the same with a 2nd window by slinging it to the right, and it'll fill-up the right-side of your display. You can start comparing two windows in...an Aero Snap. Aero Shake and Peek are cute, but not nearly so helpful.

#4 TASKBAR
Gone is the Quick Launch bar that too many people didn't know existed. Now, the whole Taskbar is a quick launch bar -- drag and drop any program icon onto the bar, and you're one click away from starting the program. Also, it's so easy to move the taskbar around now. I keep it on the left vertical on my computer. Gone is the system tray, too -- Notification Area takes its place. The Action Center alerts you to anything you need to do to keep your computer working smoothly.

#5 PROGRAM COMPATIBILITY
Any program can be run in one of many compatibility modes now. Windows 7 has a wizard that will help you pick the right, earlier version of Windows under which to run an older program -- just right-click on the program icon and choose ""Troubleshoot Compatibility"". Or, You can do the same thing more quickly by right-clicking on a program icon, click the Compatibility tab, enable Compatibility mode, and select the earlier version of Windows you want to run with your program.

#6 STICKY NOTES
Less functional that the Vista Sticky Notes -- which nobody used -- but now I actually use Sticky Notes to put reminders on my Desktop. They're quick, easy, and work just like a regular Post-It note only you don't get fingerprints on your screen!

#7 JUMP LISTS
There are two kinds -- Jump lists that let you quickly pick a task to perform, and Jump lists to quickly select a document to open and edit in the associated program. Jump lists include most recently used files, or you can pin your own files, too.  These are nice time-savers.

#8 SAVED SEARCHES
In Windows Explorer, you can create filtered searches and then save them in your Favorites for later use. This is handy to find filtered data in the future. When you re-execute the search, it creates a dynamic results set (so your search is never stale).

#9 CONTENT VIEW & ARRANGING
Also in Windows Explorer, two new features. Now you can arrange a folder into subdivisions by date (great for your pictures folders!). You can use the Content view to combine thumbnails of files along with details that usually are found only in the Details view.

#10 USER ACCOUNT CONTROL
Most everyone hated UAC in Vista (even though it helped to keep your computer safe). In Windows 7, Microsoft tamped down the annoyance factor of UAC. You can change your date and time without setting off UAC, for example. You can also decide whether UAC should go into secured Desktop mode whenever it does get triggered (secured Desktop is when your screen darkens and you're forced to respond to UAC's dialog box asking permission to run a program or make a change to your system). You can easily turn-off UAC, too.

#11 PAINT, WORDPAD, CALCULATOR
All three of these utilities got updated. Wordpad and Paint have the Office-like ""ribbon"" now, and Calculator has a few new memory keys, touch sensitivity, and a Programmer view for those dealing with hexidecimals and binaries.

#12 HOMEGROUP SHARING
This is the easiest way to share data with others in your (home) network. HomeGroup creates a password that is shared among computers, and that takes care of all the issues with user accounts, file permissions and ""access denied"" problems. This is great for unsophisticated home networks.  I made this feature last because I'm not using it -- I just think it's a great idea for inexperienced users.  Note:  all the networked computers need to be running Windows 7 to make HomeGroup sharing work.

Upgrading advice:  I went through the upgrade process twice.  Here's what I learned to do before and after the upgrade:  1)  Remove Adobe Reader and reinstall the latest version (9.2 as I write this) after the upgrade.  Older versions of Reader won't render correctly in Windows 7 and an IE8 browsing session.  2) Remove your antivirus, anti-malware and anti-spyware programs, and reinstall them after the upgrade using the latest versions available.  3)  Remove any virtualization programs (like VMWare Workstation) and reinstall following the upgrade.  4)  After the upgrade, look for the latest video driver from the video card maker, not by your computer hardware vendor (in my case, it was getting a new driver from Nvidia rather than from Dell).

Looking to do a clean install using this upgrade disk?  You can, but here's how.  Insert the DVD and choose ""Custom"" to do the clean install.  During the install, DO NOT enter your product id or activate Windows -- yet.  Instead, you'll finish the clean install, reboot, then use your DVD to do an upgrade of the clean install of Windows 7.  Yes, you're upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 7.  After you upgrade, then enter your product id and activate Windows.  I haven't tried this out personally, but others have and have done so successfully.  Add a comment to my review to share your experience if you go this route.  Final note:  This tip isn't intended to circumvent the stipulations in the licensing agreement for upgrading your computer.  If you're not entitled to upgrade (because, say, you're using Windows 95, 98, 2000, or ME), then you must buy the full version.  As I tell my kids, ""Just because you can do a thing doesn't mean you should do a thing.""  :-)

And finally, my few quibbles with Windows 7:  My Dell XPS M1530 has always had sporadic issues resuming from a sleep or hibernate state under Vista.  That still is the case, even with Windows 7.  I'm not convinced, though, that the underlying problem is an operating system issue as much as a hardware/BIOS problem, so I can't knock Windows 7 for this problem.  Not all my laptops have had similar power-on problems, even under Vista, so my advice to you is to NOT expect Windows 7 to solve any power-on problems from a sleep or hibernate state if you've currently got those problems with your laptop.

Lastly, if you like to periodically examine the Reliability Monitor in Vista, it's not as nice in Windows 7 -- there is no precise data value assigned to your machine's ever-changing reliability metric.  And it's impossible to find in the Control Panel (but it's easy to do a Start Search on).  The graph is still there, though, and it's updated hourly instead of daily.  For most people, I'm guessing this is a complete non-issue.

"I upgraded from a 2008 version, so I was able to use that for three years. For the 2011 version, that will work out to $20 per year. Having the ability to download from my mutual funds and credit card is worth that to me. I don't download directly from Bank of America because they charge $10 PER MONTH! for that capability. So I have to manually download the transaction files and then update Quicken. (BoA bought out my former bank, so that is how I ended up doing business with them.)

Yep, there is not all that much change, except for the new file format. I am glad, however, to have that aspect tidied up. There is also an improvement in the use of Help. Unless it has not worked correctly on my computer, what I have always found is that if I opened Help and then switched windows to go to another application, when I Alt+Tabbed back I could not get to Quicken directly; I would always be taken to Help. And I would have to minimize Help to see the register. No more. I can directly switch back and forth among Quicken, Quicken Help, and any other window.

I had no problems installing and switching over to the new version. I haven't had it a month yet, so all I have done is download and enter transactions. But it has been smooth sailing, except for one glitch, and that one has been a problem for years. I decided to try out Quicken Support's online chat, and I got an immediate solution.

The problem has been that when funds were swept from my IRA brokerage account to my IRA money market account, sometimes Quicken would seem to get hung up on the issue that the money market account cannot have cash balances. For reasons I have never figured out, it would not use the share purchase information in the downloaded transaction, and I would end up with a BoughtX transaction that didn't buy anything. When that happened I would manually edit the transaction to fix it. Instead, the tech support person told me to use Ctrl+z. That shortcut recalculated all the transactions in the account and fixed the flawed transaction. I have to say that I am pleased with the support I received; my problem was fixed in minutes. It should not have occurred in the first place, and that is why I didn't give a five-star rating.

We see this all the time in the technical field, so often that we generally tell the customer (that's ranting on about how a product doesn't work when we know it does) that their hardware or software issue is called an ID-IO-T (pronounced I-D, I-O, T) error.  It makes them feel good, and they don't even realize that to the tech working on their issue ID IO T really means (idiot).

"First let me say that I'm a software developer and my girlfriend is from Germany. That being said I can say, from a developer's point of view, the software is top quality. And from a language point of view the phrases are practical and spot on or so my girlfriend says so ;)

The lessons are well organized. Each one builds on the previous. I feel that I don't learn too much in each chapter, avoiding that overwhelming feeling of too much at once, and that I don't learn too little. After a few chapters I can easily mix and match the words I've learned to create new and useful sentences. I do it all the time with my girlfriend to which she often replies ""sehr gut!"".

What I like most about Fluenz's approach is it's like a classroom. Meaning, there is a real person who breaks down each chapter's conversation and explains why you use each word in the way it's used. Most software just gives you words and expects you to memorize and learn through ""immersion"". I won't get into that debate because it's been debated all over the Internet ad nauseum. But if you're like me and learn faster by having someone break down each word of every sentence and explain it in great detail then you can't go wrong with Fluenz.

Oh and my favorite part of Fluenz is actually two things: top notch support and the free flashcard application. After I've done a chapter I feel pretty good (languages seem to come easy to me...either that or Fluenz is just that good lol) but once I've done the flashcards I feel like it's cemented in my brain and I can move onto another chapter much sooner than if there wasn't a flashcard system.

One one new Dell machine with a DVD drive, Automated System Recovery went very well.  Then after an early drive failure, I found that system restore did not work quite so well.  I was never able to boot the drive after several attempts at recovery.  That sort of defeated the purpose.

On another new Dell machine with a CD drive, I could never span disks with CD-Rs.  I ruined about 25 in the process of trying.  Memorex CDs showed erros with every attempt.  CD-RWs *would* span!  There was no mention of this in help files or by tech support.  But the program will not complete the system recovery for some reason with CD-RWs either.  After a few hours of mostly attended backup due to CD size, I get lockups on disk 3 or 4 or 5.  But who knows if the restore would even work if backup did?

I doubt that most reviewers will attempt a recovery just to test software.  I would love to speak to anyone who has successfully done so.  At this point, I seriously doubt that it can be done.

The software does fine on individual data (groups of files) backups and restores.  If that is all you want, go for it or get any free zipping utility.  If you want protection for a drive crash, I hope you have better results than I've had.

"TaxCut offers individuals a powerful option for preparing an income tax return that is relatively easy to use. TaxCut assumes that you know little or nothing about income tax law. The software will ask a number of questions and will prompt you for information based on your answers. It will help tremendously if you gather as many of your tax documents as possible before starting. This software is significantly cheaper than paying a service to prepare it and much easier than doing in manually.

The e-file option has been around for some years and is a great way to get your refunds faster. But if you owe money, there's not as much of an advantage.  Still, you get five free electronic filing so you might as well use one.  In the unlikely event that you plan to prepare more than five returns, make sure you use the e-file for the ones due a refund and file the ones with money due manually.  The program will print all the forms you need so it's easy to do and it will save you the cost of the fees for the additional e-files.

There are a couple of issues to take note of if you buy this version of TaxCut.  First, this version covers only federal tax returns and does not include a program for state taxes.  If you live in a state with no income tax, this is the version you want.  But if you do need to file with your state, you'll want to buy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/H-R-Block-TaxCut-2008-Premium-Federal-State-e-file/dp/B001HOD50K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">H&R Block TaxCut 2008 Premium Federal + State + e-file</a>&nbsp;version.

These probably won't be needed by everyone, but take a good look at the chart in the product description area to see if you will miss the features or not.

If you don't itemize your deductions and have a very simple return, you might be better off preparing the forms manually on your own.

"Several years ago I got Guitar Hero and Rockband for my family to play with.  We loved it and had a lot of fun with it...for a few months.  It didn't take long before I felt like i should be doing this with a real guitar instead of a plastic controller.  I searched high and low and there were no apps of any kind that could do that.  Fast forward a few more years...and I find Rock Prodigy...exactly what i was hoping for but better.  Something I can use my guitar with and learn to play.

Although I think the technology is great and everything - technology is just that...it's an enabler.  The real value I see here is the combination of this technology with the carefully crafted lessons and exercises and a lesson plan for what to practice and when.  Then there are the milestone pieces to really test how much you've learned...they can be real challenging and a lot of fun.  Over time I've noticed, that although the lessons and exercises are focused on a particular set of skills, there are actually multiple things being learned and reinforced in each one - this is what i mean by being carefully crafted...i'm learning more than i even realize and that really  does make the most of my time and learning.  Learning is fun i'm rarely ever stuck on anything so I am able to keep practicing - this is key.  Before RP I would find myself getting stuck on something and then i would stop practicing...for days, weeks, or even years before i got back to it.

Customer support has been fantastic.  The folks at Rock Prodigy answer every little question that I have about the app and have helped me to get the most out of it.

Challenges that I've had?  Well...it's a guitar...a musical instrument and not a plastic controller.  So I needed to learn how to tune it, turn up the volume and tone knob so the app could hear it better and not be so darn heavy handed with the strings since it can change the notes to be sharper than what is expected and the app will miss it...which is good...we're playing guitar here not Mario Brothers ;-)

I'm near the beginning of course 2 right now and for the first time I find myself watching the app and not looking at my left hand nearly as much.  My fingers are starting to find their place on the fretboard more easily...well a good chunk of the time anyway...but progress is happening and that keeps me playing!  I have a long way to go...but I feel like something is changing in me and the guitar doesn't feel as foreign to me as it used to.","Hey, I'm really learning this stuff",False,1380672000,2.6390573296152584,1.0

"There are seemingly a myriad of illustration programs and some do things better than others. Most digital illustrators work with several because no single application seems to do it all so well. But, I have to say, Serif DrawPlus X5 comes pretty close.

If I could make the perfect vector program it would be Autodesk Sketchbook, but Sketchbook is a bitmap program. What I like about Sketchbook is the intuitive, simple (but beautiful) interface. If I could write a program with all the features I could ever want I would make something like Adobe Illustrator. Adobe products are, for the most part, the heaviest on features but just so difficult to learn. Seems like I'm always jumping through hoops to get anything done in Adobe. Too many options. That marriage between the two programs, Sketchbook and Illustrator, might just be right here.

DrawPlus has similar buttons to Illustrator but unlike Illustrator, they tell you what the buttons do when you hover over them. This is incredibly helpful for the new user trying to remember what is what or trying to discover what other functions they might want to explore. Exploring in Illustrator is a hair raising experience. As in, 'I sure hope Ctl+Z can undo this and my program doesn't freeze trying to execute it'. On top of the descriptive hovering, the tools just make sense and seemed grouped together in a very logical fashion. For example, you don't have to go digging around to make simple shapes you use a lot, just click on the shape tool and the choices are there. I like that a lot.

Editing is a snap. DrawPlus gives you a shape or line with the simple understanding that it is made of points (nodes) and that you might want to move these nodes about a little. Simply click on the 'node' tool, select your point you want to manipulate and there you have it. Even better, the 'simple' shapes (circle, square, etc.) have built in node sliders that quickly let you make common adjustments to common shapes, which is just a brilliant feature. E.g. Do you want a square with sharp corners or rounded ones? How rounded? Well, just make a square and slide the lever to your roundness liking and there it is.

There are more features (animation, filter effects, etc.), or should I say enough to make most if not all of your graphic needs with very little effort in very little time. I was up and running creating graphic creations within 20 minutes. THAT'S what a vector drawing program SHOULD be like.

And here's the better part- they let you try it out (DrawPlus Starter) for free. Some of the more exciting features are disabled but there's certainly enough to get a great feel for it AND, best of all, no time limit! I tried it, LOVED it, and bought the full version.

"Years ago, Norton was the leader in anti-virus. They also had fantastic customer service, with actual English-speaking support personnel based in Sunny Southern California--both on the phones and online. Then they got too big not only for themselves but for average computers--bogging down operations to a crawl. (Maybe that was their way of avoiding viruses was to make the system inoperable...?) They shipped all support issues to Sunny India and it was rare you could get someone you could understand. I stopped using Norton at that point because in addition to losing their support, they slogged systems down horribly. So I was glad to hear a Fry's Electronics' employee recommend them because they were much faster than they'd been. True, they were, but they still dragged the system horribly. Pages that used to load in a snap now had a five-second or more lag time. Programs that used to run effortlessly now locked up, froze, and forced a hard shut down. Mysteriously, it would even swap my icons around, exhanging pictures of one for another. Add to that you have extremely little control over what runs and what doesn't. Plus, it simply didn't work on a basic level: I play online games and it couldn't prevent an advertising hijacker from forcing my browser to visit their game. Another knock was that Norton was too intrusive on your system and this continues. Not only did I have to use their foreign support people to remove a four-year-old version of Norton that was STILL on my system after all this time, but even THEIR OWN removal tool to remove 360 didn't work because a scan shows there are STILL remnants of 360 on my system.

"The Mapsource TOPO product in theory has plenty of detail for what you use it for.  It has the equivalent of a 1:100,000 scale Topo map, showing major features, contour lines, trails, etc. It also provides additional streets, highways and roads that don't come on the Etrex Vista base map.
However, there is a major problem with the viewability of the topographical map information on the screen of your Etrex.  The Mapsource TOPO maps have some sort of background shading.  Perhaps this is color detail (e.g. green means vegitation).  The problem is that on the screen it is just dark grey.  With this dark gray background on your Etrex screen, you can barely, if at all, see any other map features, your route, waypoints or tracks.
Therefore, loading the Mapsource TOPO map on the Etrex practically renders the Map screen on the Etrex useless in the back country.  I found this out the hard way on a hike up in the mountains, when I really wanted to be able to make out what was on the map screen.
In case you think I just don't know how to adjust the screen contrast on my Etrex, I tried that, with some very minor improvement.
Other than uploading maps to your Etrex unit, you can use Mapsource TOPO to create routes and waypoints when you plan your hikes and then use the software to upload the data to your Etrex.  However, as an avid National Geographic TOPO user, I find these tools in Mapsource to be way less user friendly.  If what you really want is software to help you plan trips, routes, etc., you definitely need to buy National Geographic TOPO.

"I purchased Sketch Book Pro specifically for doing initial (draft) sketches of network diagrams, flow-charts, and other telecom engineering work. In the past I've found most drawing programs to either be lacking in features or far too complex to learn and use for simple sketches. What I needed was a program that could allow me to do a mix of vector object placement and drawing as well as free-hand sketching (with a Wacom tablet). Having tried many programs (like Iluustrator and Corel) I found them to be geared towards artists and designers as well they should be. I had resorted to using Microsoft OneNote (which I still use for other purposes) for sketches.

Sketch Book Pro offers the simplicity of doodle/sketching with some of the finer features of a mature drawing application such as pressure sensitive support and controls,support for gestures, flexible placement of pallets, etc.

In addition to these benefits it is a very reasonable price compared to other products. I do not use the painting features, but the pencil, marker, and other features are perfect for sketching and initial concept work. Compared to doing a first draft in Visio, freehand sketching a network design with Sketch Book Pro and the Wacom takes about 1/8th of the time.

"I have used True Image 2010 to clone my laptop SSD to a larger SSD. The program did a good job of it and impressed me at that time. Later, I decided to use the the backup feature of the application. Now, that was a challenge and never materialized. The program started to give me errors and interrupt the backup process. The 2010 program was buggy and it appears that the 2011 version did not fix the bugs!

I emailed their customer service about the errors. They suggested I would delete an entry in the My Computer. I did that and tried the backup again. This time the program passed the last error fine but gave me a new error. I emailed them again and after some emails going back and forth from their customer desks in India they asked me if they could call me at home. I said yes, gave them a time to call me, the time came and gone and no phone calls!!! After a few more emails I gave up on their customer service and uninstall the program from my laptop.

"I have used Corel Painter and Painter Essentials since 2008.  My first experience was Painter Essentials 3 or 4 (bundled with my Wacom Intuos 3 graphics tablet).  I used Painter X up until OSX Snow Leopard (10.6) ceased to run it (thank you for nothing Apple) and I upgraded my PC beyond 8GB of RAM.  Since then, I've been Painter-less and itching to get back into using it again.  While other programs come close, Painter has the best simulation of oil and other natural media.

I purchased Essentials 5 to get that back.  Unfortunately, it won't even install on my Windows 7 Pro workstation.  Windows installs go through a browser based setup and use Active X controls.  Despite my best efforts to turn these off, and make myself vulnerable to malware while doing so, the Windows installation never gets beyond the browser window ""Loading""

So I went and installed it on my late 2009 iMac 20 inch running OS 10.9.5 and it installed and ran just fine.  Not that I mind that Mac, but its only got 4GB of RAM and a 128 MB ATI video card compared to the 16GB of RAM and 1GB NVIDIA on my workstation running Windows.  This limits the images and workflow.

Lesson learned, don't bother with Corel products.  They still don't know how to produce quality user friendly software.  This will be my final Corel product ever.  I will save my money for their competitors (take Smith Micro putting out Manga Studio for example, you can still Manga Studio 4 Windows or Mac, and it's the contemporary of Corel Painter X which is now a coaster on my desk collecting dust and coffee stains).

"I upgraded from 2011 to 2013 and have been somewhat disappointed.  It could be that I'm running into launch bugs that will be worked out over time, but as of right now (January 2013) I'm rather frustrated.

After upgrading none of my custom reports function anymore.  Even when you go in and re-select the proper categories / accounts in the saved custom report it won't display any data.  You have to re-create your report from scratch (mirroring exactly the non-functional existing report), and for some reason this new report will work whereas the old one won't.  Frustrating.

Also a little frustrating is the fact that my checking accounts won't stay in the proper category.  I have two separate checking accounts linked with investment accounts (one account for a rental property and another account tied to a brokerage account).  For some reason every time I log in to Quick these two accounts are now listed under ""Banking"" instead of under ""Investments"" where they used to be.  I keep moving them back but every time I log into Quicken they're back under ""Banking"".

One minor irritant is you no longer have the ability to view balances in the ""Accounts"" bar but exclude them from totals.  This is something I had been doing with education savings plans as well as accrued cash value on life insurance policies.  It was nice to see the sudden jump in net worth when I upgraded, but since it is artificial it's irritating.

The bright spot is that Quicken now appears to update my mortgage balance as part of the auto update, which it wouldn't before.  The downside is that although it downloads things properly for my primary residence, it won't show transaction detail on the mortgage for my rental property.  You can go into settings and see a check box you should be able to uncheck to show transaction level detail, however it's grayed out, so all you see is a little pie chart and the total remaining.

I did try to call customer service which was strange.  You have to submit your issue online, and when you think you're done they just give you a case number and a phone number you can call.

I've gone through this twice, the first time I contacted customer service was to question the reports and I was told that you just have to recreate those.  Not exactly what I wanted to hear after hours spend perfecting about two dozen reports.

As I found the other apparent bugs I tried to contact customer service a second time.  I submitted everything online and then called the number.  After sitting on hold for 22 minutes waiting for someone to pick up, I heard a click then silence as my call was disconnected.

The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because I've been a loyal Quicken user since 2000, and it really is a great product and is fantastic for managing your personal finances.  Quicken 2013 still seems to have some issues however, so for now only two stars.

"This is the best program I've used for designing rooms.  It is not for blueprints or detail in wiring etc.  It is for drawing a room to size and then working with different types of furniture, paint and fabrics, to get an idea of what will fit in the designated space as well as how it will look when completed.

Also, although there are a lot of colors for painting the walls, in reality, there's not that wide a range.  Overall though, this program is easy to learn, and easy to use.

"If you are looking for the best Antivirus program, each person/company has there own story about why XYZ is better than the rest. I have used pretty much any Antivirus program out there both at personal and business level. There are some good comparison articles on the web that compare Trend Micro with Symantec and McAfee. You will find viruses and spyware that Trend will find that Symantec may not, ones that Symantec will find that Trend will not, visa versa. I actually dropped Symantec cause it did not detect a virus that got onto my computer. I ended up having to reinstall Windows, and then loaded Trend on it. I actually plugged in a thumb drive that apparently still had the virus on it and Trend caught it. It did not clean it but it still notified me that it saw it.

I also switched to Trend cause it usually is cheaper than the other major vendors, it is easier to use IMHO. It has its short comings, but so does the other vendors. One particular thing on Trend Micro is the alert messages you get on changes being made to your computer (like your home page on IE changing) does not actually tell you what is changing, just prompts you to allow or disallow. On most occasions I know what was occuring at the time the message appeared so I can answer appropriately.

With the spyware side, I did not buy this product for that. If you think you have spyware go download Spybot, it's the best spyware scanner out there and it's free. Trend's attempt is decent and it will mostly tell you if something is trying to change a setting or add a file that looks suspicious but I don't think it is going to catch everything out there. Spybot is something I've used that works best for spyware once you think you have been infected by it. The newer versions of Spybot might have preventive scans or warnings but I have not used in for a while. The best defense against spyware, know where you are going on the Internet.

"Accountants who use this product need to be aware of a few things. First, the annual closing apparently does not involve closing the P&L balances and writing the net amount into a retained earnings account. However, it appears to be done if you look at the next year to date, so maybe that does not matter. What does matter is that you should set a closing date which denies access to a prior closed period unless the person is properly authorised. Quickbooks appears to do this under password control which if it worked would be good. In my case, the confirm password field was grayed out so I could not confirm it. More serious still I called Quickbooks to point out this apparent bug only to be told by someone who ominously identified himself as Mike 07 (James Bond type?) that to get this solved I needed to buy the support package. I asked for his boss and was put on hold for 20 minutes or so until they hung up. In summary, there is a looseness in Quickbooks in relation to accounting controls, systems integrity and professionalism, the software is quite easy to learn and use, but the support appears to be as uncompromisingly unfriendly as Microsoft's. Further Mike 07 had a strange accent that was really difficult to understand. Accountants should be very careful about whom they allow access to in the system and regularly print out last years balance sheet and compare it with the one they used to file their returns.

"I bought Band in a box, after reading about it on both ebay, and amazon, and their home page. I bought band in a Box 2012, Mega Pak, for about $205.  I read the 300 pg owners manual at least 3 times, underlining, highlighting.  Finally I set out to compose some tunes, and I had some very surprisingly good results. From all appearances, this is one product that seemed to be over-delivered, and by that, I mean despite its hokey name whoi9ch put me off to almost not buying it, I thought the makers of BB had actually done a good job at the software, and the owners manual.
Now, here is the Dark cloud that goes with that silver lining:
If you get this version, with mega pac, about 1/2 of the ""Styles"" will not be available. Also, many of the drum track are likewise, unavailable. WHY? Doesn't MEGA PAK mean anything? Well, not when you compare it to ULTRA  PAK, which has ALMOST everything, and for about what I figure to be only about $35. More. But, here is the rub. You buy BB with mega pak, decide you really7 would like to NOT keep having those pop up windows, stating, ""File not found... style not found..."" or ""Drum track not available for this style..."", and you then come to the conclusion that you SHOULD have bought the most complete STYLE collection (ULTRA PLUS PAK), they will sell you not just the additional styles, but you also have to BUY the BB software all over again!  Well, thats fine for their bottom line: MONEY, but what do you now do with TWO BB softwares? To UPGRADE, they require you to buy the second BB software, which, you ALREADY HAVE, and to buy a second one, is redundant, not useful at all, and just more money.
The best thing you can do, is buy BB WITH the Ultra Plus Pak, containing almost ALL of the styles. When i was on their website, thanks to a link they gave me, I listened to a huge list of styles. I wrote down all the ones I was interested in, went back into the software, onoly to find, I did NOT HAVE almost ALL of the best choices, because I ""should have bought ultra pak!""  And since the company does not allow for you to only upgrade the styles, but FORCES you to buy an additional copy of the software, (WHICH I ALREADY HAD IN THE FIRST PLACE), I can only say you will be very limited if you do not buy at least the ultra pak of styles.  In addition, the package I got, also comes with ""REAL BAND"" which looks like a cut down version of Band in a Box user interface, but I found no documentation for it, to tell you what is is useful for.
I got a good deal, price wise, from The Midi Store, in the LA area. But they do NOT give you the same kind of customer support as the Home company. But even contacting BOTH of them, neither one would sell me the Upgrade to the ultra pak, without me HAVING TO BUY YET A SECOND copy of band in a box, so, if I did that, what use is it to HAVE two copies of the SAME SOFTWARE???? Why should they make you buy that second copy, knowing it is useless?  They made no effort to comfort me on that issue!!!!! So, that act alone made me STOP recommending this software to many of my musical friends. It just didn't make any sense at all, to be forced to buy something over and beyond what I needed.  So, if you want to buy band in a box, do yourself a big favor and make sure you at least get the ultra pak 2012 version, or else, half of what you probably will want to do, will be unavailable, as I found out only AFTER my purchase/installation/ and actual trial and error.  I do like what i did buy, but now that I see how it really is, I am pretty disappointed that I did not have this clear of an idea BEFORE I bought this product, and if I were to do it again, I'd get the Ultra Plus Pak, MINIMUM.

"Having had a hard drive failure years ago, I realized that a real test required that I actually buy and install a new hard drive and determine whether the product lives up to its claims. I needed a full system backup anyway since many of my applications are upgrades to previous products (eg. VB-4, to VB-5, to VB6, upgrades of Excel and Access and so on) and the intallation on a new computer took a full 2 weeks to set up.  I have a factory installed Western Ditgital Diamond Caviar 500 gb HD on a Dell Inspiration 530 Vista 64 bit OS. I am evaluating Acronis True Image Home 2009.
It took 6 backups (5 failed -not caused by Acronis) and many many hours before I finally wound up with a set of reliable backup dvd disks. If you have a boxed copy of Acronis, you can use their installation CD as the boot disk. I created an additional bootable installation disk to make sure the bootable wizard works.
I suggest that anyone wanting to tackle this chore not make my first mistake: backing up to 'write once' disks.  My first attempt was a sector by sector backup requiring 12 dvds.  On my first try and after 3 1/2 hours the last disk (disk 12) -the machine hung. I had to reboot. Acronis attempted to continue what it was doing. Windows loaded again and Acronis informed me that it had finished. Having spent all of this time on disks that could not be written to again, I decided to swap in the new drive and try anyway. I ended up with a semi-functional OS, a corrupt registry, and a version of VB troubled by the corrrupt registry. The installation took almost 3 hrs. The next day I used the Validate function in Acronis - it told me the backup archive was corrupt and caused by poor quality of the backup media (the dvd disks). Only then did I realize the folly of not using DVD RW. 5 more installations and many many hours and a week later and I finally have a working set of backup disks. I had to discard 3 dvds in the process. One lesson - if you don't use the Validate function in Acronis to test the backup, you are wasting your time. For backups I am using Verbatim DVD+RW media. Several of the dvd disks had to be discarded when Acronis reported that the newly created backup archives were corrupt due to poor media quality (at 1st I didn't think the media might be problematic). Certainly it would be discouraging after spending many hours or days creating a backup only to discover when needed, it really wasn't a backup after all.

I do have a suggestion for Acronis. The Validate function should be able to validate sequentially each of the disks as the backup archive is being built. Presently you can validate the archive only after the whole archive is built. If the 4th or 5th disk out of say 12 or so is defective, you won't find out until the last disk is made and the Validate function has read each of the disks starting again with #1. When you get a failure error while validating that particular disk then you'll know that disk has to be tossed-but then you have to start again w/ disk 1. I have a hunch the other programs are similar. Wouldn't it be better if you were notifed while backing up to a particular dvd that it was faulty so you could skip it, substitue a new dvd and keep going. ALSO, if you have a large HD to back up, CREATE a MIRROR image instead of a sector by sector backup. There is a huge difference in the size and the amount of time spent. Validating the archive will take about the same amount of time as creating the archive. When I finally created a successful backup, the install went quickly - approx 1 1/2 hours to restore & without a hitch.  The lesson from my vantage point is buy a new hard drive before your current hard drive fails and test until you are confident you have a realiable set of backup dvds. If you don't want to use the new HD right away, seal it in a baggie, then insert it into another baggie w/ rice to absorb any moisture and keep it in a cool place. I have not significantly evaluated the other features. One other note: there is a small timing error I came across when using the backup OS (wizard if you like) to load the backup archive. When I inserted the DVD into the optical tray, depending on when I shut the bay and pressed RETRY, sometimes the RETRY button would not work. Clicking on the BROWSE button and reloading the archive allowed the restoration to continue.
-2wks later- I can report that the Clone Disk wizard (HD to another HD) located in the Utilities menu worked without a problem. It deleted the old partitions on the new test drive and created a new working bootable drive (this was a test again as there are no problems with my primary drive) easily and quickly.
-In a much later test of the DVD backup I made, I found a backup archive that previously worked, now backed up but with significant flaws. My thought is that the problem with the backup was caused by the DVD media. I'll try again later to see if magnetic media is more reliable.

Two other issues & I am still learning to work with this product.
-Using disk cleanup to securely delete a large file .9 gigs causes the cleanup window progress bars to stop working. You can't tell whether anything is happening. I let it alone for 15 minutes, came back and it appeared to have done nothing. Actually it had deleted the file. Without working progress bars there is no way to know when and whether it finishes.
-There is no way to download a fix from the application. I would expect Acronis to remedy the above problem. But the software should periodially check for fixes. It does not.

"Coherence desktop sort of works with Retina display.  However, there are many Windows applications where their user interface (UI) (especially simple text buttons) gets incredibly squished together or clipped.  It must have to do with how the software is written.  Things like CADs and drawing programs will have their own UI that the Retina conversion makes menus unusable.

It would be nice if Macs could be used professionally outside of desktop publishing or DJing, but that is more Apple's problem of marketing only to the idiot consumer that likes shiny.  Retina screens in particular are an example of this, though I would expect Parallels to test the product themselves on common professional software.  If Coherence fully worked on the Autodesk or Dassault product lines it would be a good price.

Coherence in a Linux VM is crappier and less developed/supported.  There are no options for it nor any great detail on what desktop features break it.  And when it 'works', fonts are usually aliased badly as well as much of the UI.

Parallels also has an option to make the windows UI look Mac.  Don't do it, it doesn't change window management placement.  It just makes the frame 'look' similar to a default Mac theme.  It also isn't Coherence compatible so the window frame and icons shrink back to super high res.  It appears to be some freeware they downloaded and tossed on to the menu options long ago and don't maintain.

Parallels does an OK job sharing your user folder and online shares (SkyDrive and Dropbox anyway) between the host and virtual machines.  Other than the file sharing and Coherence, Parallels offers nothing over free software like VirtualBox.

"This software is very good. I installed it on my daughters Windows 7 laptop and it runs perfectly.  I actually purchased the software over a year ago using Amazon download.  My daughter loves it.  She is homeschooled.  The software is very exciting, has lots of games, and is very interactive.  It covers a lot of subjects ranging from multiplication/division, addition/subtraction, all the way to grammar and reading exercises.  It teaches spanish, has chess game, and Mavis Beacon typing game in it.  Elementary Advantage is for grade levels K-5.

Did I mention that it also teaches phonics.  The software is so good, I spend a lot of time with my daughter just listening to it teach. The software starts from low level difficulty and gradually raises the difficulty level over time without the child really noticing it.

I honestly feel that the software is better than most public school classrooms because my daughter spends hours on it and she starts telling me word for word what she's learned about grammar as well as the other topics the software teaches.

The software allows for more than one child to use it through the use of profiles.  Its provides very low level simplistic grading system using different color stars. Bronze, Silver, Gold.

There is a downside to the this software and that is if you need to use it to keep records of progress and curriculum for states that require it, this program does not do a good job of that.  The reports it produces are more for the child themselves and not for adults.

Overall I rate it a 4.  I would have given it a 5 if it had better progress reporting system and performance tracking built in.

I highly recommend it. Your child will love it and their grades will improve.  You will see them learn so much on their own without a teacher or parent looking over their shoulders.  That's when the real learning starts when the child learns for the enjoyment of learning instead of it being a chore.

"Just wanted to alert others to the horrible experience I've had that is still ongoing as of today. I purchased Enhanced Payroll about 2 months ago.

As others have mentioned, I had to call to activate and give them a credit card number. I only have 1 employee and I made it clear I did not want to auto renew. I ended up having to give my credit card number anyway as that was the only way they would activate my license.

Several days ago, a charge on my card from Intuit for $436.43 appeared. No warning. No invoice. No receipt from Intuit showing the charge.

I called support right away. First they tried telling me that there was a per paycheck fee. I had to explain that since I only have 1 employee, I'm not subject to any fee. Even if I were $436.43 is obviously incorrect as I've only run payroll twice a month for 2 months.

I gave the support rep the license number I purchased 2 months ago. She said she would investigate and call me back on my mobile within an hour. I waited 3 hours. I did not get a call back so I called again.

Again, I had to sit on hold then explain my situation from the top to a different rep. I was asked to email a screenshot of my bank statement showing the charge.

I sent the bank screenshot, my case number, and screenshots from my Intuit account showing that my original license didn't expire until June 2015. 48 hours went by with no response. I sent a follow up email. Still waiting...

"In my previous review of Windows 8, I excoriated the product for how the ""Windows Update"" process interrupts regular usage of the product.  That was two years ago.  I have some new remarks to add:

I recently purchased a new PC.  The performance of Windows 8 on this new PC is really awesome.  Running on an SSD, I can hardly believe how fast it boots.  As creepy as some people find Microsoft's usage of the cloud to log you in to your personal computer, I appreciated that for once, I set up a new computer without having to dig thru the configuration to tell Windows that I want to see file extensions and drive letters.

Alas, I still think that Windows 8 is an even worse product than when I previously reviewed it.  I recently traveled with my computer.  I thought that I might have some free time on my hands during the trip, so I installed a video game from Steam.  I didn't know what internet access I might have on my trip, so I made sure that everything worked well before leaving home.  This was a good decision in retrospect, because my internet access was limited to unreliable ""aircards"".

Almost immediately, I started having problems where various parts of Windows 8 didn't work, including the ""Start Menu"".  I did a Google search and came to the conclusion that I needed to do a ""System Restore"".  System Restore fixed my Start Menu, but removed my Steam game that I had recently installed, so I wasn't able to enjoy it during my trip.

Three weeks later, I started having another strange problem.  I started seeing the error message that I couldn't log in with my profile, and was being logged in with a ""temporary profile"" where I couldn't use my files.  I checked the ""Event Viewer"" and saw a registry error message.  I did a Google search and once again, the solution was to use ""System Restore"".

Having lost stuff on my machine last time I did System Restore, I made a backup of my ""Documents"" folder.  When you run ""System Restore"", it clearly tells you: ""System Restore does not affect any of your documents, pictures, or other personal data"".  I'm glad I made a backup of my ""Documents"" folder because System Restore trashed everything I did in ""Documents"" since the restore point, in spite of the message to the contrary.  I could have lost hours of hard work!

Microsoft, your product is unreliable in it's purpose and it's design is a menace to the data that we entrust to it.  I want Microsoft to know that I've been a professional software developer using Visual Studio (which is an awesome product), but if I can't trust my operating system to do safeguard my work; if I can't trust my computer not to delete my work in the course of its regular operation, I'm going to have to move to a different platform for my professional work, despite the investment of time and energy that I've put into becoming a .net developer.

***

Following is my original review:

I am an IT professional.  I will be turning 30 this year, and my family had our first computer when I was 10.  I've seen 20 years worth of different versions of Windows, and this one is just awful.

Most complaints I hear about Windows 8 center around the ""Metro"" UI.  I personally don't like the ""Metro"" UI, but don't consider it a reason to avoid the product.  After all, people will legitimately disagree about how a computer interface should be designed.  My overall take on ""Metro"" is that it is a one-size-fits all solution for phones, tablets, and PCs where one size doesn't fit all!

I must add that one positive thing about Windows 8 is that it is a little bit easier to set up in a dual-boot configuration with Ubuntu Linux.

My big issue with Windows 8 has to do with Windows Updates.  Since Windows 7, I have had mixed feelings about Windows Updates.  I understand that security patches must be periodically installed to protect the Internet at large from wide-scale virus infections, malware, etc.  I find it annoying that Microsoft programmed Windows 7 to automatically install updates when rebooting and even to display instructions: ""Do not turn off your computer.""  Personally, I consider the idea of a computer giving orders to a person absurd.

Here's the experience with Windows 8 that has convinced me to recommend avoiding Windows 8 to everyone I know.  Today, I had to boot Windows because I had a task to do with some hardware that doesn't work with Ubuntu.  At the end, I had some information to key in to a web form.  While filling out the web form, Windows 8 presented to me a warning that the computer was about to restart in 15 minutes to install Windows Updates.  Ten minutes later, it showed me a warning that the computer would restart in five minutes.  Fortunately, I was able to finish filling and submitting the web form before time elapsed.  However, just to see what would happen, I waited five more minutes.

What happened next nearly made my blood boil.  Normally, I try not to allow a computer (a tool) to make me mad, but I must make an exception here.  The thing that happened was the computer automatically restarted without warning and began to install Windows Updates.  As I said, I was able to finish my task before the time expired, but suppose I hadn't.  This web form didn't allow me to save my work.  I would have lost what I was working on!  It's one thing that the computer would give me orders: ""Do not turn off your computer.""  It's another thing entirely for the designers of software that I paid money for the privilege of using to design the system to usurp my control of my computer and make it do what they think it should do instead.

I'm reminded of the old joke about the Explorer shell in Windows 95: ""It says 'My Computer' because Bill Gates thinks that putting Windows on it makes it his!""

My recommendation is: Avoid this product.  Stick with Windows 7 or try Ubuntu instead.

I think Macromedia raced to get this one to market. I've been using Dreamweaver since version 2. It's a powerful tool that has evolved into something close to remarkable concerning development of professional web sites/applications. But...

If you have Dreamweaver MX 2004, you have a better version of Dreamweaver than version 8. I can't use 8 in a professional environment due to the way that it stamps file times incorrectly. Collegues are left wondering what the real time was that a page was last worked on. Sometimes the FTP doesn't upload the files that are selected.

I was excited to get this software and it installed fine and I had fun selecting cards and customizing them.  Easy and fun to use!!!  However, two problems:

(1) The software led me to believe that online cards were included.  To send online greetings, you need to pay extra at the Hallmark site (annual fee).  The software ONLY includes a link.

(2) Cards look terrific on the PC as edited and saved...  I sent to my local printer (UPS store) for quality color printing on card stock and the result came back with very poor resolution graphis.  Very grainy pictures and the words were almost blurry on the card.

"I've used TurboTax every year since the mid-90's but I'm dropping it now.

This is the second Netflix type blunder Intuit has made.  Several years ago they dropped Quicken for the Mac because, as everyone knows, no one uses a Mac and Apple is about to go bankrupt.  That worked out well.  I used it since the early 90's but one day, they said it's not gong to be compatible with this new fangled Intel based Mac thing.  No market there, have a good life (here's Mint).  I switched to MoneyDance and could not be happier.  When Intuit finally came out with a Mac version a couple years later I have not switched back and won't.

* The very first thing you'll notice is this ridiculous validation scheme. Think you're going to buy software and install it and go to work? Wrong!! You have to be validated first which, if something goes wrong, can take DAYS!

* The multiple undo's would have been a great feature for 1998, even now not everything is undo-able.

* Quark has this wonderful new system of ""Projects"" and documents. If you ever pick-up an old document to make some changes and then re-save as a new one, the old file name remains with the file because Quark assumes you're just adding a new document to the project...A MAJOR ANNOYANCE! If you do use the project thing as intended (multiple documents and sizes wrapped up into a single file) you still have to collect each individual document seperately! HELLO?! HOW BOUT ""COLLECT ALL""??

* The ""Export to PDF"" feature so rarely works, I don't even bother with it. I still have to ""print"" to a PDF.

* The ""full resolution preview"" isn't and frequently causes crashes when trying to change the preview res on a picture.

* All the old stupid annoying things about Quark are faithfully preserved in version 6...

  * Still no ""update all"" feature in the links menu.

  * Still no way to select a graphic and tell Quark to re-link to something different.

  * Still no key commands to select tools on the tool palette.

  * Still limited to 48x48"" layouts.

  * Still no support for  OpenType. If you use OpenType fonts, expect lots of very strange letter spacings, etc.

* Lots of people still use Quark 4. If you need to save down, you must save from Q6 to Q5, then Q5 to Q4. If you're upgrading from 4 to 6, YOU'RE SCREWED! Quark 6 WILL NOT save down to Quark 4!

* Quark brags about all these new features that NOBODY will have a use for. Web pages?! PLEASE! Not even even a half-a** hack web designer would try to create a website in Quark!

I ordered this after getting QuickBooks Pro, which didn't work well for me at all. I went with Sage for the inventory management system they had.

"My cousin's pit bull bit my RX100 and broke the LCD. Other than that, only a couple of toothmarks were on the front of the thank-heavens-it's-metal body. I sent it to Sony who told me it would cost $300 to fix and in their opinion it wasn't worth it. (There's a PhD thesis in there somewhere.)

When I found this replacement LCD I was ready to take a chance. It turned out to be a Sony OEM screen (or a really good forgery), so that was good. However, I got no installation instructions with it. I emailed the vendor and they sent me a PDF showing how to take the body apart, but not how to install the screen. After a second email they directed me to a YouTube video of someone replacing the LCD on a different model, which is of limited help.

All my life I've been the kind of person who takes things apart just to see how they work. I would advise anyone who has NOT had experience doing this that they should buy the screen and have a camera repair person put it in. It should take a pro 15-30 minutes and be well worth the money. Me? I managed to get through the process, although there were a couple of leaps of faith (push the detached back of the camera and the screen pops out). The most difficult part was attaching the floppy bit of the LCD connector to the camera; this really needs a special tool. After closing up and trying the camera the first time it didn't work - bad connection. So I took it apart again and pushed harder, hoping I wouldn't bend anything so much that it broke. It worked.

So, if your camera takes pictures but the LCD is broken, this replacement will work and save a $500 camera from the dustbin. Just be aware of installation issues.",Tricky installation but worth it,True,1377475200,2.6390573296152584,1.0

I tested freebies, cheapies, watched videos, read reviews, etc etc.  Still I was pretty set in my ways so nothing was quite right.  Initially I wasn't sure this was right, still, by the end of a demo period of the full version, I'd fallen in love and was able to recommend it to my mom as it's available on both PC and Mac.

"My opinion about McAfee's new Internet Security Suite Version 7.0 has changed little from my last years review of their Internet Security Suite Version 6.0, although I gave the newer version 2 stars instead of 1 star from last year.

Installed the software on my desktop as per the instructions and there still is an issue with the Privacy Service Component of the software. Contacted McAfee thru their web page support service. (You have to chat with them as before because it is the only free customer service offered, and telephone service is fee based.)

After installing all four components (Virus Scan, Spamkiller, Privacy Service & Firewall) I could not establish an internet connection. I discovered on my own thru trial and error and installing and re-installing each component one by one, that the Privacy Service Component was to blame. After going thru a lengthy procedure from McAfee.com to remove the Privacy Service Component (it's not as simple as Control Panel/Add or Remove Programs) and re-configuring my internet connection setting, and re-installing Privacy Service, I finally was able to establish the internet connection. Total time spent reading, researching, installing, re-installing, customer service, chatting, etc.... was approximately four hours. A little less time than last year but due to a different problem.

Some of the problems you will discover is that this software does not like Windows Service Pack 2 or any other additional security software to be installed on your computer. In fact, all other security software (including McAfee own last year's version of the product) must be un-installed before proceeding to install the new year's version. But, not a word of this is mentioned in the installation/Users Manual.

It seems the issue with Windows Firewall being turned on when installing has been resolved.

I did finally manage to get this software to function properly, but only after countless hours with customer support and trial & error of my own. And one good thing that resulted was I was already prepared for these issues when I installed this software on my laptop. This installation went flawlessly.

Last year I said I was switching to Norton's version of Internet Security Suite. I should have listened to my own suggestion.",Second try at McAfee products,False,1127088000,1.0986122886681098,0.0

"I am an American...of Asian and Caucasion descent.  I grew up speaking both Japanese and English fluently.  Since both languages came naturally for me, I always ASSUMED that other languages would also come easily for me and that by the time I was 'an adult' that I'd be one of those ""intelligent, wordly people"" who would have the ability to blend in various countries and speak 5 languages.

Then reality hit when I was in school and took a Japanese language class for an 'easy grade'.  I was shocked at how HARD it was to learn proper  sentence structure, conjugated words, variations of words, not to mention the different 'ways' and 'classes' of speaking from slang to appropriate to professional language then I graduated high school and took a professional translation course and found out that it even harder than I had ever imagined.  It dawned on me that it would be MUCH harder to learn other languages that I didn't even speak a single word of besides the mainstream words such as ""Ciao and Bravo!"".

Fast forward a few years and put the daily responsibilities of working, paying bills, then starting a family, raising your children, keeping a household, etc, etc...I'm creeping up on middle age and still only speak 2 languages...so much of my dreams of becoming a wordly citizen fluent in 5 languages, right?

Well, enter The RosettaStone, my renewed HOPE!!! I have attempted to learn Italian and Spanish from TV, books and tapes from other programs and have never been able to concentrate ENOUGH to absorb the teachings long enough to walk away and retain the words to use it in 'real life'.  The Rosetta Stone is structured so that it teaches you to make real use of it, it's structured so that you don't simply go through the motions of their program but you ACTUALLY REALLY, TRULY learn to SPEAK it!!!

This works SO well that I told my husband although it's not something to get through in a few days or even a few weeks, I feel confident enough that by the time I'm finished with this and he goes through it, we'll be able to take one of our dream vacations and go to Italy and actually be abel to get around and speak the language!!

I would HIGHLY recommend this program to anyone who simply wants to learn new languages for fun OR for business!!!

After I complete this Italian Rosetta program, I plan to move onto their Spanish, French and possibly Mandarin versions!!  So my travels will have to hold off until our children are a bit older but at least NOW I WILL be have the ability to speak their native languages to communicate, find out what I'm eating, learn more details about their cultures and customs and simply thoroughly ENJOY visiting and learning about other countries first hand instead of thumbing through a translation book and travelling with a tour guide being guided through like a herd of cows.

"I used to work solely in Front Page but a friend, in the advertising industry, kept nagging me about I really needed to learn Dreamweaver.  So I've been taking a community college course in it this term.  My assignment, due in a few days, is a 5 page website and I must say that I've done an excellent job building it in Dreamweaver. I don't use templates.  I build from the white screen. I haven't begun to explore the depths of what Dreamweaver can do but already I can feel its power.  Everything you need, and I do mean everything, covers the screen real estate while you work.  If you need to get a better look at what you are building, you can easily collapse those other features so you can swell your web screen and html screen space.  Perhaps my favorite feature is the html code itself being viewable the whole time I'm building and that I can go from my web building screen to my html screen just by moving my cursor.  Dreamweaver also does not stick things I don't want into my html code which Front Page did.  (However, to be fair, when I began using Front Page, I couldn't do anything with html code anyway so that was hardly a problem)!  I also love that Dreamweaver prompts me, when I'm in the html view, about what I might want to add at that point.  Could I have used this product this effectively if it were my very first time working with building a web?  I doubt it.  There are people in my class, though, who do have entry level ability and they've decided to learn Dreamweaver as their first and only web builder.  In the long run, they probably will save themselves a lot of money and aggravation by doing so.  I would call myself an intermediate level user so I cannot evaluate this program for advanced users or programmers.  As an artist who uses Photoshop, Dreamweaver integrates beautifully with Photoshop.  The two programs work very well together and I need that as I use far more images than text in my websites.  For a user like myself, Dreamweaver is fabulous.  For a beginner, it is going to be a challenge but doable with the right learning aids such as a community college class.",Just did a Magnificent Building Job!,False,1044403200,2.8332133440562166,1.0

"There is something you need to understand about this excellent product:  It is a trimmed down compile of the Sony Vegas PRO product (which sells for much, MUCH more).

It has most of the features of the professional tool turned on, and it priced very affordably.  However, because the interface is designed for professional video editors an editing novice may find the UI little overwhelming at first.  It is completely worth the effort of learning.  The power to create polished video (and sometime save bad video that is a key shot) is a real head rush once you get there.

This version of the product includes a normal DVD with demos of how to operate the software.  If you are new to Sony Vegas, please take the time to watch them and follow along on your PC. You will find more tutorials at the Sony Vegas web site for more advanced techniques.

This is not a simple `drop in a few clips and burn a DVD/BluRay' tool.  It allows you immense control over your video and audio.

In all honestly, you can produce professional level video with the Sony Vegas Movie Studio HD Platinum 11 Production Suite.  It is only when you are working with high-end HD cameras that you must spend the extra for  Sony Vega PRO.

Here is a cool thing about learning the less expensive version of Sony Vegas: Everything you learn works exactly the same way in the PRO version should you ever `step up' to that level (and you get unlimited audio and video tracks with PRO, too).

I have used many video editors for PCs.  The Sony Vegas family of products has been the most reliable and powerful that I have ever used.

"Its me again The Hebrew Hammer... once more reviewing ADOBE products.  I urge anyone attempting to purchase DIGITAL MEMBERSHIPS of ADOBE any ADOBE software. While their apps used to be top of the line, with their new business model ADOBE so much praises they have committed an atrocious act by leaving decades long customers like myself out in the cold. There are many equal if not superior software alternatives to ADOBE. ADOBE had us used to believing they were the best, and I see many having the inner issue that they do not want to leave ADOBE, becoming slaves to their DIGITIAL SUBSCRIPTION. This new CLOUD thing, is nothing more than an attempt to make more money from its customers Adobe believing that since their products are superior we wouldn't complain and be forced at gun point to buy into their new scheme. It will be pricey to subscribe to a rental of applications that you FIRST do not and will not own. SECOND, while the price might seem good at first it will chew into your profits monthly at $9.99. Many businesses do not have in their budget to be paying into a subscription like if it was a darn UTILITY BILL. Many business have the initial large amount of point of sale purchase license price of $699/$899 and get to keep their physical product which they own. But to force businesses large or small and make us believe we do not have a choice is wrong. THIRD, remember by a wise consumer ponder on this for a second. This is a subscription, it is not a contract you and ADOBE are not bound to anything, what if in say 2 months from your purchase, ADOBE decides to up the price say an unsuspecting $5.00 to their monthly fee.

"ACD Systems FotoSlate 4 has the potential to be a really great piece of software. Unfortunately it falls short for my use. Perhaps if you want a single document with different layouts for each page and are going to do a lot of adjustments by hand then this will be just the thing for you. What I was hoping for was the ability to take a large number of images and put them on multiple pages, either 6 or 12 per page, with the images scaled and rotated properly and with the file name as the caption. It looks like the software is supposed to do that but it doesn't. There is an option to ""auto-rotate images"" but it either rotates all images (even those that didn't need to be rotated) or it doesn't rotate any. So, all images are printed in either vertical or horizontal orientation, rather than the appropriate orientation for the individual images. It is possible to manually rotate those images that are wrong but it's impossible to select multiple images so you have to do it one image at a time. That's quite time consuming when you have hundreds or thousands of images to rotate.

Although the ACD Systems web site has user forums and there is a link to submit technical questions, they seem to be either broken or simply abandoned and not actually in use. There are recent posts in the forums for other products but not for Fotoslate. Once registered you'd think I could post to the forum but that feature seems to be broken.

"I've noticed some of the reviews here seem to tout the features of this software, but the authors do not necessarily indicate that they have actually tried to use it, which makes me a little skeptical of their 5-star ratings.  Let me say up front that I have actually used it.  Also note that I have used quite a few different types previously, my favorite being Adobe Premiere Elements.

This version from Pinnacle is not by any means user friendly.  If you are a novice, you won't find that the process has a ""easily walks me through it"" design to it by any means.  It is, in fact, fairly difficult to do even basic things...like add titles or captions to the timeline.

You will see a tab toward the bottom called ""SmartMovie,"" that does make things a little bit simpler....but even with this option it's still not all that easy to navigate your way through the process.

Two main things about this software that I found fairly annoying:

1) If you want to view the online training videos from Pinnacle, you can only do so if you subscribe to their site for $7 per month....otherwise the video stops about a fourth of the way through and a pop-up pushes you to make this purchase.  Until you do, you're blocked from viewing the videos.

2) It does not burn to Blue-ray discs unless you download a plug-in that will allow this feature, which also costs $7 to download.  Really Pinnacle?  I mean....really?  Even the MyDVD software that comes with it has a burn to Blue-ray option on it, which is greyed out because you have not yet purchased the plug-in.  Horrible business model, IMO.

What I did manage to do was to burn a short 4GB AVCHD movie on a DVD DL disc, and I was able to include a title for it.  Oddly, the transition from one clip to another had special effects built in for switching from one clip to another...swiping from left to right, loading the next clip from the middle out, etc.  At first it was pretty cool to look at, but eventually it got annoying.  I was able to finally figure out from the manual how to go in and take the transitions out of the timeline.  It was strange to me that these special transition effects were set up by default.

When I tried to burn a larger, 10GB movie (as a side note, all of these are HD family vacation footage), of course I couldn't load it on a DVD DL disc due to its size, so I decided to save the file and then I would burn it from my Adobe software. Halfway through to exporting it to the folder, however, the Studio 20 software froze up and stopped exporting....so I had to close it.  BTW, I have a fairly robust PC....Core i7 CPU, 12GB RAM, etc.

Basically, unless you want software to make AVCHD movies less than 8.5GB in total size that will not burn to Blue-ray unless you download a plug-in at an additional cost, I would look elsewhere.  My suggestion is Adobe Premier Elements....that's the one I have had the most success with.  I can't recommend this one.","Not user friendly, and lacks some key features you should be aware of.",False,1474761600,2.772588722239781,0.0

"I have been using computers since 1991 when I went back to college for a degree in Computer Information Systems and Certificate of Achievement in Microcomputer Applications. I have had several computers and am now using a Dell Dimension 8300 3 GHz , INTEL CPU with 2.5GB memory with XP Pro AND a Dell Vostro 1000 laptop 1.8 GHz with 1 GB memory and AMD64 CPU with XP Home.  I used McAfee starting in 1991 when it free from a bulletin board and then when it was bundled for a fee, then started using Norton Systemworks 2000 - 2005 (which all included anti-virus), Norton Professional anti-virus, Windows Live One Care, Norton Anti-Virus 3 user 2007 , 2008 and recently 2009 when I couldn't use the PC Tools Internet Security program.

I decided to try to install PC Tools Internet Security on my laptop because I keep it pretty clean, transferring files to my desktop computer.  The install disk took a very short time to install - that was nice. BUT...and this is a pretty big ""but"" for me...No matter what I did, my WLAN card was of no use -- Windows kept closing it because there ""was a problem.""  I couldn't register the program because I had no Internet -- because my wireless was not usable.  Because I could not activate the program, I could not use it for updates yet.  I could not access the Internet to find out what the problem so I could not activate the program.  A catch-22 situation.  No Internet meant no program.

I went through all of the settings and told the program to give full access to my WLAN card but it never worked.  No matter what I did I could never get to the Internet.  Made me mad.

A little aside -- when you are asked to activate the program you type in your name, your email address and the multi-alpha numeric product key.  When you click on activate, you are met with -- sorry but there is no Internet and it keeps your email address but you must re-enter your name and product key over and over as you try to register your product.

I never recognized most of the items the lists of choices showed so had no idea if I should allow or block them.  Even with the Zone Alarm Firewall I used to use I knew what most programs were for.  The software didn't seem to block my Explorer browser but did block items like Linksys EasyLink Advisor.  And I guess the program also blocked my WLAN wireless card.

As soon as I uninstalled the program -- which took two tries and two reboots, my wireless access magically came back along with the Internet.  What a relief!  But now I had no Anti-Virus protection.

The software seemed promising -- I thought there was a nice thick manual inside the box -- apparently the manufacturer thought that the heft of the box might lead buyers to think there was something in the box besides a disk.  I couldn't believe it -- a 4 1/4"" X 5 1/2"" X 1/2"" thick notepad with a link to ""special offers for retail customers.""  There was a small flyer with instructions on how to install the program and a few other instructions as well but the manual was on the disc.

Since my Norton Anti-Virus had expired (I will never again wait until my current anti-virus program expires to install a new Anti-Virus program so I can use the old one until I get another new program) I ended up downloading the free version of AVG and going to Costco to buy Norton Anti-Virus/3-user software so I wouldn't be without protection on my two computers.  No waiting until low sale prices with rebates or anything a/c I was desperate.

I see by the other reviews that most were able to use the program after any difficulties.  Maybe they are all IT's or MIT graduates.  Programs shouldn't be this difficult.  I thought the program should be more intuitive and not block everything on your computer so you can't even use it.  People complain about Symantec's Norton Anti-Virus but I like all of the programs I have used except their Internet Security from 2004 -- it just slowed down my computer as well as others in my family including one who had a BS degree in Computer Science and a LOT of work experience with computers.","Only for the VERY informed computer user - not me, I guess",False,1239408000,0.0,0.0

It will take over your computer and if you try to get it out of there it may cause a big mess. That's what happened the FIRST time I tried to use the program.

Then I found out you can't use both the English and the Spanish versions on the same machine. You can't use more than one copy of DNS on one machine. When I bought the Spanish version (after purchasing the English one), I found this out the hard way. The rep did not tell me though that if you just get the Spanish one, you can make a profile in English and Spanish using just that one. Things would have been a lot easier if she had. When I got my machine into a mess trying to put the Spanish version on, I called them and another rep essentially told me that you can only use one language at the time. The gist of it was from what he said, one language, one machine. This turned out not to be true. Later, I had to uninstall my English copy and it wouldn't uninstall properly, so I called them again. The rep sent me a link to download a removal tool which worked fine. That particular representative was extremely knowledgeable and very helpful. While I had him on the phone I mentioned the bilingual problem and THEN I was told that the Spanish version will let you set up profiles in both languages. Well, I now have the Spanish version installed on my machine and it works fine for both languages.

So, in my experience their customer rep department is batting 33%. Or however you say it.

The program itself is not difficult to learn but it will perform SIGNIFICANTLY better if you have copious amounts of written documents and e-mails on your computer that have the same sort of vocabulary that you use.

"For would-be professional singers or even ""American Idol"" wannabes there are superior singing programs out there, but this sure seems to be the one that provides the most fun. This package is ideal for people who perhaps have never had a singing lesson ever and who have a hankering to improve their singing while having some fun in the process.

The software adjusts to each individual's vocal range, and the program begins with some valuable warm-up exercises. The interface employing a talking microphone, a singing squid, and the cute-and-sassy ""Carry A Tune"" female student character is clearly geared for children, but it's certainly fine for teens and adults, as well.

The lessons start VERY easy, and gradually work up to more demanding tasks about halfway through.  Yes, it's a bit hokey to begin with ""Hot Cross Buns,"" but the point here is that one must crawl before one walks or runs, and the use of very simple tunes allows singers to concentrate on getting just a few notes right before moving on to more complex note sequences.

The theory behind the lessons is that by providing an onscreen guide to notes that tracks the actual frequencies associated with the singer's voice, the student can learn to control the notes through a kind of self-adjustment feedback process.  There are no miracles promised here, however, and if a person has an inborn tendency to waver or wander off key, I really doubt that the twenty lessons provided in the program will totally eradicate these problems.

However, seeing where and how one has a tendency to miss notes is, in fact, helpful, and the learning process can be augmented through slowing down the inherent beats of songs.  Once one masters the note changes while singing slowly, the metronome speed can be gradually increased.  This is a very useful feature!

What makes this package even more enjoyable is that the program doubles, essentially, as a vehicle for karaoke.  One can download up to twelve free MIDI with lyrics songs from the program's own website.  These files are set up in the same way as the lesson tunes, i.e., with words on screen and a tune/pitch guide that the singer follows as he or she sings the song. The choices of free songs is pretty limited, but fortunately, there also are links to a few MIDI karaoke resources where there are hundreds of additional songs available. These can be purchased at what I think are reasonable prices, and this way a user can establish as large a library of singalong while training files as one likes.

Yes, the microphone headset provided is cheap, but it's actually quite adequate for the task at hand (and as an environmental science teacher, let me assure people that the ""lead hazard"" warnings are a kind of pro forma thing; only if you chew on the microphone are you likely to have any chance of experiencing ill health effects here).  The sensitivity of the microphone is not impressive, but it's good enough for training purposes, and one can always purchase a higher-quality mike if need be.

Overall, I think this program is a terrific value.  It provides some real vocal training for beginners, turns itself into a kind of self-contained karaoke machine, and best of all, it's FUN!  Highly recommended","And best of all, it's FUN!",False,1175990400,2.6390573296152584,1.0

"About the time Windows Vista came out, I switched to Macs. For the most part, I never found myself wanting for software offerings unless it was (1) a game or (2) genealogy software. Sure, there was Mac software, but it just didn't appeal to me like FTM for PC did. When a version was finally released for the Mac a few years ago, I was ecstatic, only to be thoroughly disappointed when it turned out to be something like a port of a PC version from years before, and wouldn't even read the PC database file without a sketchy conversion process. Finally, with FTM 3, PC and Mac users are on more or less equal footing. Perhaps the most notable improvement, and the one which appeals to me most, is the fact that the database file is finally ""native"" for the Mac version. I was able to easily put my PC file on a flash drive and open it with FTM for Mac 3, make some changes, save, and then open it back up on my PC. In fact, I can now just store the file in my DropBox folder and open it on whichever computer I happen to be near. Though I really only have a PC for gaming, I can now comfortably abandon FTM for the PC secure in the knowledge that if something should ever happen and I need access to FTM on a PC, I don't have to jump through any hoops to make things work. I can e-mail the database file to relatives who have a PC without having to worry about losing data in a conversion (and they can send their PC files just as easily). It really is a game-changer for me, and I'm glad I've stuck with FTM long enough to finally see this development (though it should have come years earlier).","Finally approaching feature-parity with PC, and PC database works on Mac!",False,1397692800,1.9459101490553128,1.0

"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turbocad-LTE-v3/dp/B00446CFF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turbocad LTE v3</a>+I have been delaying this review until the company corrected a glitch in the program, but it has been almost three months without resolution. It is past time to warn other shoppers.

The program is IMSI's DoubleCAD drafting program with a different user interface to make it look and work like AutoCAD. Great idea, because no amateur can justify the staggering price of AutoCAD. I was an AutoCAD user for over 20 years and, now retired, had AutoSketch on my Windows XP home computer. When I got a new computer with Windows 7, it would not run the old program. They quit making AutoSketch, so TurboCAD LTE seemed like my best bet. I didn't want to have to learn a new interface.

The program loaded and started ok with just two problems. The Help button brought up an error message instead of opening an interactive help feature like all other ordinary programs. This started a long and unproductive series of telephone and e-mail exchanges with ISMI's so-called Technical Support. They finally quit responding to my calls and e-mails so I contacted Customer Service. They were courteous and apparently trying to help, but so far without sucess. I think that Technical Support is stonewalling them too.

It appears that ISMI has made a market decision not to support this program. They have a forum for other programs but none for this. They could fix the flaw in the program that prevents the operation of the Help function. I am convinced that it is a minor programming error. I was able to get enough information from the DoubleCAD forum, but not from Technical Support, to fix the other glitch that was keeping another feature from working properly.  It is a pity, because it is a nice program to use otherwise.

Although I cannot, in good conscience, recommend anyone buying this product, I secretly hope many of you will. Then we can convince ISMI to support it.",Pretty good program but no support,True,1316131200,2.6390573296152584,0.0

"To begin with, I am an old fan of the original Land of the Lost TV series. I am also not a fan of Will Farrell. Yet I was willing to give this thing a chance. I almost wish I hadn't. The best thing I can say about the film is that it was not as bad as the reviews led me to believe. The fact remains that it is still a terrible film in almost every way.
The cheesiest thing in the film was how they worked the original lyrics of the opening theme into the script and then later had Will Farrell sing a terrible version of it as if to slam us over the head that this was supposed to be based on a beloved television series. The overly-intelligent dinosaurs were an insult to the intellect of the viewer. The story of the rivalry between Enik and the Zarn seemed artificially grafted into the film instead of being an integral part of it. Personally, I was miffed that they made Enik a megalomaniacal villain (he was originally a neutral character helping the Marshalls for his own selfish but understandable reasons) and the Zarn into the victimized guardian. In fact, they completely changed the nature of the Zarn altogether (originally he was a being made of colored lights who was sensitive to human thought and emotion and was more neutral than evil).
The story runs that disgraced physicist Rick Marshall has invented a machine which can open a doorway in time and space. A grad student named Holly convinces him to to build it and they use it to open a portal to the land of the lost, inadvertently taking a tour-guide biker named Will along with them. Once in the Land of the Lost, they rescue Chaka, a Pakuni prince, from being sacrificed by userpers of his throne. Rick Marshall acts superior to everyone and everything in this place, which pisses off Grumpy, the genius T-rex who, for some reason, understands English. We also have no good explanation why working with Chimps has made Holly fluent in Chaka's language. After lots of bad jokes based on the original series, they find the Lost City of the Sleestak. They included the message scrawled on one of the rocks ""beware of Sleestak"" from the original TV show without explaining it properly. They have been led here psychically by Enik who is trapped inside. Enik tells them that his people's mortal enemy, the Zarn, is planning a Sleestak invasion of Earth. Rick must find his device which was lost when they entered the Land of the Lost in order to defeat the Zarn and get home again. It just goes downhill from here. The film ends with Rick Marshall and Holly falling in  love, Rick Marshall making friends with Grumpy, the T-rex (Grumpy was grumpy because of an intestinal blockage. Don't ask how it gets fixed), and Will remaining behind with Chaka and his people. And the invasion, which is really being planned by Enik, is stopped.
What really gets me is that the original television series has a number of episodes which could have been strung together and, with a bit of tweaking, become a nice two-hour film: The Marshall family is vacationing in the Grand Canyon when an earthquake accidentally opens a time doorway to the Land of the Lost. They make friends with Chaka who helps them get through the first few weeks of their exile. They discover the Pylons and the Lost City teeming with Sleestaks - and mabe have a run-in with Captain Colli and his canon, Sarah. Deep inside the Lost City they find Enik in his secure cave. He agrees to help them, but it is a trick. By falling into the Land of the Lost, they have caused a paradox. They go through the doorway, fixing the paradox and fall back into the Land of the Lost again. But all is not lost. Chaka takes Rick Marshall to see a special ritual performed by Ta, the Pakuni elder which opens a time dooway in one of the pylons. Rick Marshall steps inside, ignoring Chaka's attempts to stop him. Meanwhile, Holly and Will go out hunting for their dad only to be confronted by a ghostly image of Holly. The Ghost beckons them into a cave where they are forced to help alternate versions of themselves and their father who are stuck in a wall by completing a circuit of crystals in a matrix table. When the smoke clears, they find themselves outside with Chaka running to get them. They follow chaka to the Travelling Pylon just in time for the door to open and Rick Marshall to step out with the news that the pylon is their ticket home. Next morning, they get inside the pylon and the last part of the film includes a series of stops on alternate worlds and times. Finally, they climb out of the pylon in a remote part of the Grand Canyon. An old, wreck of a car leads them to believe that they are in the wrong place until around a corner comes a troup of tourists on the backs of donkeys. I would maybe include Mrs. Rick Marshall as well as a female guide for Will to ogle.
The point is that this film should have been a reverent, serious sci-fi epic rather than a cheesy satire which puts down the original source material every chance it could get.

PIA promises to not log your activity which is very important to me, but that doesn't matter all that much when the client randomly disconnects and the ""kill switch"" safety feature doesn't work.

Also, with one of the more recent updates, even using PIA has become a problem without using a third-party TAP driver because doing so renders my offline computer usage extremely sluggish.  Right now I have to use an older client with a third party OpenVPN driver just to be able to connect.  The product has become unreliable, something I would understand if it were a free service.

I have a vacation planned to the Caribbean, so I thought I'd load it up with some maps of the area.

Next the program couldn't find the CD even though it was in the drive.  I rebooted, and the software now sees the CD and comes up.  The first thing it says is that I need version 4 of the firmware in my GPS.
I have version 2.
Ok, so I go to the Magellan site, and look under their support section for discontinued models...and there were no updates available.  Nice.
I finally ended up at the yahoo M330 group (those folks are great!) and found advise and files to upgrade to version 4.

I owned Studio 8, and it worked fine.  Went to Studio 9, and had a few problems.  Upgraded to Studio 9 Plus, and after a week of trying to make it render my projects with no sucess, and crash after crash, I removed it from my machine.

They sent me an offer of their all new 10.5 plus upgrade, Hollywood FX, 3 of their Premium packs, and a hat that says Studio 10 on it.  This said that the program had been rebuilt from bottom up.  This program should be called ""Crash after Crash"", and the only thing that works is the hat.

"Traditionally, I shy away from giving a 1-star review. It's very primitive; you aren't fully satisfied, so you throw a 1-star review on to cause a stink.

I am a (reasonably) tech-savvy guy in my mid 20s. I saw that Windows 8 was going to be...how do I say it...unique? But it touted that it was going to be ""built on Windows 7"" (hence the ""upgrade""), and very stable. I adopted this myself, and told all my nay-sayer friends that they should get on board as well.

It booted up very fast, at first. Then, over time & for no reason, it got a little slower. Maybe added 8 seconds. Did I mention I had a SSD? So it was like going back to a HDD-boot. Annoying, but okay. The layout is very different & I didn't like it much at all, but I decided to stick with Windows 8.

...until my PC downloaded an update for Windows 8, that is. I paid no attention to what it was; I just saw my system was downloading an official Windows 8 update & it would install when I shut down my PC. Typical, right? So I shut it down, it starts to install. It reboots, continues the install. Then it hangs. I know better to interrupt updates, so I let it hang. For hours. Then, when I finally killed/interrupted it by shutting down & restarted, it wouldn't boot into the OS. I tried everything! It was dead, and I'm still recovering from it.

TL;DR? I don't blame you. Bottom line: An official Windows 8 update killed my laptop! Also, the layout is just flat-out weird. This OS is truly deserving of a 1-star review; I am going back to Windows 7 Pro 64-bit to STAY.","A Windows 8 update crashed my laptop, would not boot into OS",True,1356220800,2.079441541679836,0.0

"After reviewing product reviews for previous versions of Math Advantage, I purchased a copy of the software. Even though most of the reviews for the older verions of this software are negative, I told myself that they must have worked the bugs out for this version. However, once loaded to my computer I knew better and once again remembered that you can't expect someone else to change. Once I loaded the precalculus/calculus cd into my computer it loaded and created a shortcut as I expected. Then the software prompted me to type in my name, which I did. My name is Brian; however, when I typed B-r-i-a-n the display showed Br5an. I retyped, thinking I had made an error but got the same thing. I tested the other keys by opening a blank Microsoft Word document. I discovered that most of the keyboard was reconfigured. I ran some tests to include a virus scan and a scan for spyware that may have caused the problem. However, everything was in order. I called Encore customer service the next day. Before, I could tell the Encore rep the test results, he quickly told me that my problem could only be caused by a problem with the ribbon cable that connects the keyboard to the motherboard (I have a Sony Vaio laptop) I told the person that I didn't think that was possible since I always handle my laptop with the utmost care. He kept his cousre and told me that he couldn't think of anything else that it would be. Finally he added that he thought it would be a good idea for me to call Sony to begin troubleshooting with them. I called Sony. They told me that I should do a system restore. However, I had never made a back-up so I couldn't go back to a restore point. Next the rep. said that I could do a complete system restore. A complete system restore would wipe the hard drive then rewrite the operating system to it. That would mean losing alot of data such as over 48 hours worth of music, Microsoft Office, Norton Systemworks, and all Microsoft updates to name a few. The Sony rep stated that if the problem disappeared after a complete system restore then the problem was with the software; and if the problem didn't disappear after the restore then the problem was hardware related. I went ahead with the restore, suspecting the whole time that the problem was not hardware related. When the restore finished, I opened a blank Microsoft Word document to test the keyboard. It now worked fine, proving that the software was the problem. The moral is that Encore technical service representatives are poorly trained or are just trained to lie to get the customer off of the phone quicker. As a result, I spent many hours reloading programs and music to my system which would have been fine if I wouldn't have loaded this software.

"I used this card for several weeks on the Greek mainland as well as on Crete in a Nuvi 1450.

This might be fun to explore but can be a bit harrowing and it will take WAY longer to get to your destination.  Best to check the route out online ahead of time and put some via points along a major highway to force the route.

"Compare with LibreOffice and save yourself some money.

Corel WordPerfect Office is horrendously and hopelessly outdated. If you want to see for yourself, then find some complex Microsoft Office documents and open them up in WordPerfect X7 and LibreOffice 4.3 side-by-side and see for yourself.

LibreOffice is open source software, always free of charge, and has components comparable to the full edition of Microsoft Office.

Corel WordPerfect Office looks and feels like a program from the 1990s. It won't outright mutilate Microsoft formats, but it does not display them as the author intended them to look. LibreOffice does a much better job.

You don't have to spend any money to see the difference. Just install the free trial of Corel WordPerfect Office X7 from their site and observe the difference. The free trial is good for 30 days, but after you compare it to LibreOffice, that's 29.99 days more than you'll need.

There was a time when WordPerfect was about the best you were going to do outside of Microsoft's office suite, but those days ended, probably 10 years ago. Corel was having all kinds of financial problems in the early 00s, so they took a bunch of Microsoft money in exchange for dropping Corel Linux and their WordPerfect Office port to Linux, and ending their work on Wine. Fortunately, in the long run, it didn't matter. Linux is alive and well and I can't see anything that Linux users are missing from Corel's current line up of software.

All that's really left of the WordPerfect Office suite is a clunky eyesore that someone has patched up well enough to kind of/sort of keep working.",LibreOffice is better. Why does WordPerfect still exist?,False,1408492800,1.6094379124341005,0.0

"If you're planning on using Home and Business 2013 for a small office, you should consider finding something else. Managing multiple license keys under one account seems to be impossible. I think their new setup might work if you're a student purchasing this for yourself, and you only have one Live account and one key to manage.

If you're trying to purchase numerous keys for multiple employees, you're going to drive yourself crazy going this route.

"AVG is best known for their free antivirus though they have offered for years a full security suite. I had never bothered to try AVG Internet Security (AVG IS), mainly because it is an expensive package in comparison to most of the other offerings on the market. That said, it is a solid product and worth consideration in spite of the cost.

I should start by stating, for the record, that I had a dreadful install experience. AVG IS partially installed itself and then errored out. After a reboot, AVG IS was alive but outdated, and what was broken was the ability to update. Worse, the uninstall was also broken. After getting the uninstall ironed out, I tried to install again and this time everything was much smoother.

AVG IS is organized and clean with a very clear and easy-to-understand overview dashboard. At a glance you can tell what is active and what is not active. Double-clicking on any of the icons in this view gives access to adjustment controls by which the component in question can be manipulated and set as desired. I like this particular view. One thing that is not clear, though, is that to get to the real nuts and bolts of the various components' configurations, one must use the pull-down menus, not the icons.

AVG's firewall appears to do a good job of hiding the system on the net, locking down service ports and cutting off ping responses. I was unable to break it. However, where it gets interesting is in the control afforded the user - individual applications can be locked down, policies set for different networks, and so much more. Other firewalls do this, but AVG's organization in the interface is better than average.

AVG's track record as an antivirus vendor is well known. However, with versions prior to 9.0 their antivirus was slow, intrusive and hard to interrupt. AVG seems to have gotten the idea of how to improve this - it took about 90 minutes to scan over 1,000,000 items if you include the registry and even running at full speed I hardly noticed except for the fact that I had the task manager open and saw an occasional spike in CPU activity. I launched several applications, typed a lot, and even searched for a file on the hard drive and saw no real impact on the system. Cycles consumed seemed to be consistently under 10%.

AVG throws a lot of other things into the mix that you'd expect in a decent suite - antispam, antispyware, rootkit detection, and several other components. What surprised me was to find a process viewer that has the ability to kill processes, accessible from the dashboard under system tools. I have never worked with a security suite with that built-in as part of the package. Included is a connectivity viewer and even a startup process viewer, with the ability to manipulate the entries within. That's a very nice plus.

I've been unable to work with the antispam up to this point, as I get no spam. Even so, there are many, many settings that can be adjusted to the antispam, such as adding a blacklist server such as spamcop to assist with checking, Bayesian training and a lot more. Based on the feature set I suspect this antispam is very effective.

AVG IS includes a McAfee-style system of evaluating returns from search engines, marking unsafe links in the results window. It is not as thorough as McAfee's Site Adviser, but it is effective in giving you  heads-up when there is a possible danger ahead.

There are two things that AVG does not have that I wish were present. First, there is no parental control module. It looks like AVG made no effort at all to include a parental controls module, and while that's ok it is something that most other security suites include.  I was unable to even find a manual block list - if it's there, I cannot find it. Second, I found no ability to see the presence of other computers on the network. It is not something that I have found in a lot of suites but it's a very nice-to-have.

AVG has put together a very nice internet security suite. The main components, the antivirus and the firewall, are both very effective and all of the other components seem to be working nicely. There is room for some improvement/expansion, as is true with most security suites, but what is here is very polished and clean. AVG is a little pricey when compared to most other suites, but in spite of that cost it is very much worth consideration when looking at computer security suites. I am comfortable giving AVG IS a 5/5 stars rating - it isn't absolutely perfect, but what is there is excellent.",Solid Product,False,1259798400,2.079441541679836,1.0

The software is ok, but it could be better, I am not a fan of the zoom.  You have to go up to a zoom bar to adjust.  I also own Delorme Street Atlas and I fing that software much easier to use from a functionality standpoint.  To Zoom in the Delorme you drag a box, or stairstep out. (I know that isn't clear, but once you do it it's easy)

However the price on the Autoroute is what sold me.  I will be using it for about one week, and will probably never use it again.  The fact it sets up with a GPS is very cool, I am a fan of using a laptop as a GPS device, I will never get a pocket size one.",Could be better,False,1209340800,0.0,0.0

"I had several issues with the Spyder2 at first: for one, the 64-bit driver is unsigned and will not install on Windows 7 unless you hit F8 at startup and disable driver signature verification (every time you plug the Spyder in). Since Windows 7 is still in beta, this is forgivable. I wonder if the driver signature works in 64-bit Vista, which also has this requirement? Maybe it just needs to be updated for Windows 7. Anyway...

Beyond the driver issues, the software setup went relatively smoothly. With the software installed, I attempted to calibrate the display, using the preset 6500K setting on the display. The process took about 5 minutes and was essentially automatic. However, the results of this calibration were not at all satisfactory - the grays went from having a slight blue cast to having a severe red cast, and I almost decided to return the Spyder right then and there. However, I decided to calibrate again using the RGB sliders, and wow! I had no idea just how off the display's default colors were!

I saved the profile and all seemed well, so I exited the software.

As soon as I exited, the color reverted back to that ugly red cast that was seen on the first calibration. Despite dissociating the profile from the device in color settings prior to running the second calibration, the file was still locked after the software exited the first time and apparently was not overwritten by the second calibration. It would have been nice if the software had warned about this and prompted for another profile filename instead of silently continuing.

So I calibrated a third time using the RGB sliders, saved the profile under a different name, and now my display's color is nothing short of excellent.

If you can get it to behave, it really is an effective device.","Takes some fiddling, but wow!",False,1235606400,0.0,1.0

"The first couple of weeks on this program I picked up a vocabulary of over 130 words. I can pronounce the words, recognize them in print, and recognize them when spoken. I needed a Italian program because in the summer  of 2001 I am flying Italy to meet 17 cousins, 7 aunts and 8 uncles for the  first time since I was less than a year old. Only a few of the cousins  speak English, so I need to have some background in Italian too!
I  purchased this program because it was inexpensive and gave me 4 different  CD's for my money. The CD's include: * Talk Now! which is basic vocabulary  * World Talk Italian which is mainly sentence structure * Italian English  Dictionary * Voyage to Italy Tour
I liked this program because it is  basic and gave me a good foundation of words in Italian.  The Talk Now! CD  is broken into 9 major divisions: First Words, Foods, Colors, Phrases, Body  Parts, Numbers, Time, Shopping, and Countries for a total of 275  words.
Each of the divisions have 5 subdivisions: Print the Dictionary  for that division, Play a Easy Game, Play a Hard Game, Practice Speaking,  and Learning the New Words.
In addition there are also 2 other games for  each division set up like concentration game in the main window (check out  the card dealer!) and certificates can be printed for the completion of  this CD. Several different people can use the same CD...just log on to  retrieve your file.
The 2nd CD is much more involved. I have just begun  this CD and one of the activities involves hearing a sentence read aloud.  Then you are presented with 5 strips with phrases on them. Only 4 strips  contain the phrases of the sentence you heard. You must put the strips in  order. IT is tough because the sentences are spoken at a conversational  rate - not slowed down!
The dictionary CD is GREAT!
The tour of Italy  CD is really pretty and interesting.

"I am a long time customer of McAfee and have been paying for their product so I can shop and bank online without worrying about viruses, spyware, spam, phishing scams, hackers, and identity theft.  For all these years, I have not had to call upon customer support with any issues until this week.
I started receiving blocked program messages on my computer via my McAfee security protection.  It gave me an option to remove this blocked program, if it was not wanted, or to allow.  I chose to select the remove option, since I was not familiar with the program, but my McAfee security did not remove it.  I continued to receive this message continually throughout the day for two weeks, each time requesting McAfee to remove the unwanted program.
I called McAfee customer service on November 14, 2014, and was told that the blocked program, Artimis! C649BD39C383, was a program and that my subscription does not cover unwanted programs and that I needed to call my Dell customer service for assistance, which I did.  I was informed by the Dell representative that this was a virus, not a program, and that since my computer was out of warranty, I would have to pay a fee of $129.00 for assistance with a three day customer service guarantee.  Since this was a virus, I decided to contact McAfee customer service, again, to request assistance since I have been paying coverage for this.
I called McAfee customer service back on November 18, 2014, and was told that it was a program, not a virus as stated by the Dell representative, and that I needed to pay $69.95 one-time fix, 7 day guarantee, or $179.95 for a year for McAfee TechMaster service representative to assist me.  This call started around 10:00 a.m. and ended around 12:45 p.m.  Through all of this, it was determined through failed attempts to delete this ""unwanted program"" that it was indeed a ""virus/infection"", per McAfee rep. who assisted me.  I was given an account number for this payment and an order number. I was then informed that this was a new virus and had not been detected by the McAfee security.  The data collected from my call will be used to provide protection from this virus through future updates to McAfee security.  I requested from the rep. that since this was a virus, that I would like the $69.95 credited back to my credit card.  However, he informed me that my McAfee Security subscription does not cover new viruses that had not been detected or known about by McAfee; nor however, does it include assisting a McAfee subscription holder.
So, I pay $69.99 a year for McAfee protection surfing the web but McAfee does not provide support when its program fails to stop a new virus, then charges that customer again to fix the problem and learn about the virus so it can provide protection to their other subscription holders that happened to not get the computer virus, at no additional cost.  Have I gotten this correctly?
Through requesting to speak to a supervisor and then to a manager, it is clear that no one wanted to listen or hear me.  I can no longer say that I do not worry about viruses, spyware, spam, phishing scams, hackers, identity theft, or confidently surf the web, send e-mails, and shop and bank on-line because I am a subscriber of McAfee.  Note, I am very careful about where I go on the net and what programs I allow and receive on my computer.

"Rather than continue to respond to the ridiculous comments this review keeps getting, I will simply edit it. My original review is below. I have been told in the comments that I didn't ""understand"" how this program works when I bought it. With that I agree. I expected to be able to edit graphics. Apparently I'm too stupid to understand that a program called a ""graphics studio"" will not allow me to do that.

Let me quote from the box the installation CD came in:

""A complete graphics package and a value for the money.""

""The all-in-one studio for professional quality creative design.""

So, from this, I was supposed to infer that editing existing gifs, jpgs, etc, was not going to be possible?

I suggest to anyone thinking of buying this ""graphics studio"", and seeing all the unhelpful votes I got, that you consider it was the employees of the company that makes this software who gave me those negative votes.

-----------------------

I agree with the previous reviewer about everything.

I bought the program because of some of the cool shape options it had, which I needed to create some new images for a website. Fine.

Since it's a graphics program, you might expect that you could, for example, open a GIF or JPG file with it for editing, right? -- grab part of the image so you could move it a few pixels, that kind of thing? Nope. I even went to the Serif DrawPlus users forum when I couldn't figure out what I was ""doing wrong"", and was told ""No, you can't. It opens everything as a bitmap.""

"This will be the 11th year that I have used TurboTax to prepare my Federal tax return. Eleven years ago the user interface was a little difficult but workable. Last year the product was great and I expect it to continue to improve. Over the years, I have learned that the product is not infallible and some (but very few) mistakes were made, especially in the area of education credits and whether a ""Hope"" or ""Lifetime"" learning credit applies. I was able to successfully navigate through this problem but had to force it into the appropriate category. It remains important for the user to be aware of the tax laws so as not to be surprised by these problems.

I have always used the ""Basic"" version and have found that it meets all my needs including self-employment forms, capital gains, pensions, child care expenses, various tax credits such as the residential energy credit, and many, many more. I have never used the ""State"" product since state tax returns can be filed in New Mexico over the internet at no cost. You should check with your state to see if it has similar programs.

The only real problem with TurboTax is that the program is released early and before any federal forms are finalized. The update process is easy enough, but if you have a dial-up connection it will take a good bit of time. With a ""real"" high-speed connection such as cable, it's no sweat. This year it took me about a minute. I personally like to begin my return in December, so this is not a problem for me.

Another great feature is that you can copy personal information such as names, SSN, filing status, etc. from the previous year so you don't have to retype it this year. It also copies financial institution and W2 information which can be edited for the current year without retyping names, tax ID numbers, etc.

"I got Norton AV pre-installed into my Gateway 7422GX (6-month trial). It started being a real pain with those pop-up notices about ""your antivirus subscription ends in x days, please upgrade"", and the only options were to be reminded later, or ""purchase subscription now"". There was no ""do not bug me again"" or ""do not remind me again"".

So obviously Symantec wants to annoy the consumer a lot in order to get their dollars. I also noticed that Norton AV was using a LOT of resources (both RAM and CPU), much more than other antivirus I have running in other windows systems (Kaspersky AV -commercial, and AVG - Free Ed.).

So guess what I did?, I headed over to grisoft.com and downloaded the ""Free edition"" (free for home, non-commercial use) of AVG antivirus and I'm much more pleased with AVG now, it uses less resources and updates faster. AVG gets new virus definitions almost every day. The AVG resident shield also identified and cleaned two viruses (leaving the original .exe files fully functional, not just rendering them unusable and ""quarantining"" them like Norton AV often does).

And you can't beat the price of AVG!. Short story: before spending your hard earned money on this bloated piece of AV software, try some of the alternatives out there from smaller software companies that produce more efficient code: AVG, Bitdefender, Avast!, Kaspersky, etc.

I can really vouch for the free edition of AVG antivurs from Grisoft.com. Bitdefender is even leaner but the free version of Bitdefender doesn't have a resident scanner (you have to purchase the full version).","Uninstalled it, now using free ed. of AVG Antivirus, uses less resources",False,1137456000,2.772588722239781,0.0
"As a long time Quicken user on Windows I am beyond disappointed in the Mac version, to be frank I think it is FUBAR.  If you haven't used the Windows version and/or are new to software to track & manage your finances it may be OK.  Or if all you want to track is your checking account from one of the supported banks that may be OK too.  But if you're intending to also track your investments, mortgage, and any other loan, forget it.

What really kills me is Intuit clearly had years of experience in understanding what users want to track and manage and built that functionality into the Windows versions.  But somehow precious little of that knowledge appears to have been leveraged in building the Mac version:

Let's start with tracking paycheck data.  Windows version template for a paycheck and easy ability to input/track deductions by type....gone in the Mac.  Really Intuit, you couldn't include a template for paychecks?  Pretty much anyone tracking their finances is getting paid by someone or they wouldn't be buying your product.  Maybe you're not paying your programmers so they don't think tracking a paycheck is necessary.

Then let's talk about tracking loans.  Car loans, lots of people have them, the Windows version tracks loan details and calculates interest vs principal on monthly payments so that even if your bank does not support download of that info, you can still track it.  Windows version has similar template & support for Mortgage loans.  The Mac version just lumps all loans into a generic ""liability"" category without even including specific fields for the basic pertinent information (e.g. principal, interest rate, duration).  In fact the only really unique field is ""credit limit' which does not apply to either a mortgage or a car loan.  It's completely ridiculous not to at least include the appropriate data fields for future use.  That data could have been transferred over from my Windows version and at least used in some future release.  It just blows my mind that a financial management package can't handle a loan payoff schedule.

And then there's the data transfer.....I followed the instructions fully.  Yeah most of my data is there but somehow my investment accounts (401k & IRA) don't match, even after download from the institutions.  Judging from what I see it will take me several hours of corrections to get the balances correct and I'll probably never get the cost basis (which is critical) straightened out.

Sadly the only reason I bought this package was that my PC was about to die and since Windows 8 is garbage I thought maybe shift to Mac was a safer bet.  However this childish offer from Intuit makes an otherwise smart move quite ill-informed.  And I did look at the Quicken Windows to Mac comparison first....but apparently I was blinded by the lipstick on this pig of a product.",WOW Marketing Hype - DON'T BUY IT - Now Regretting Move from PC to MAC,True,1429747200,1.0986122886681098,0.0

A number of months ago, my main word processing program stopped working correctly. Tried to re install it and tried to fix it in other ways and nothing worked. Considered purchasing a new and similar office program from the same company but for me right that is not an easily affordable solution; it was a fairly advanced and expensive computer program and I still did not fully know why it wouldn't let edit or save any of my work.

Anyhow, I had some problems downloading from the banks with this new Quicken, which is why I HAD (yes, HAD) to buy the 2013 Quicken.

"Stay away from Norton Antispam.  It looks and acts good to start but it degrades to the point that you will have to remove it from your system to keep the computer working.
I purchased and installed two IDs of Antispam, one for a win98se and one for a win2k.  Each has become very glitchy since installation several weeks ago.  Especially on the win98se.  From the outset there were slow operations, reboots and dumb things like the game freecell not being able to work.
Today I had to remove it from both and will seek but probably not get a refund from Symantec on both CDs.
The win98se copy of Outlook simply refused to function today.  It would lock up the entire machine.  ONLY when Antispam was removed from the system did Outlook function normally and the other slowed functions work normally.
The win2k computer developed different symptoms yesterday and today.  It developed ""Slow right click"" to the point that windows explorer barely functioned.  Immediately after removing Norton Antispam the slow right click went away.  As did other symptoms like slow boot.  That was after I had spent hours trying to reconfigure administrative functions in win2k to find out what the problem was.
It is possible that the automatic live update that Symantec offers introduced an update that made both computers become unusable on nearly the same day.  Do you think I could find help on their website or on the telephone?  Nothing!  NO help at all.
I am done with a desktop spam filter for Outlook on either win98se or win2k.  And I am especially done with Symantec and their poorly written software in the form of Norton Antispam.

"When I was a kid, ""Land of the Lost"" was one of my favorite shows. The idea of falling through a hidden portal into a world full of dinosaurs and monsters was a fantasy brought to life every week. I was looking forward to seeing a new version of the original idea brought to life with better writing and special effects. That's not what we got with this movie at all.

The story revolves around Will Farrell as an egotistical archaeologist Rick Marshall, mocked for his theories of using time travel to study dinosaurs. When fellow archaeologist Holly (Anna Friel) shows him proof his time travel machine works, Marshall leads her on a hunt for a portal, which inexplicably leads them to a tourist trap run by Danny McBride. Farrell's machine takes them through a river into the Land of the Lost. They have to find a way back home while avoiding dinosaurs, the reptilian Sleestaks, and other monsters. All the basic elements are there, but it's very different from the original show.

The big problem is that the movie has entirely the wrong tone. I guess the writers couldn't figure out if they wanted to appeal to young viewers who would be excited by dinosaurs and monsters or older viewers who remembered the TV show. They ultimately went in both directions at once, which doesn't work. It's too raunchy for kids, but too goofy for adults.

I was planning to show this movie to my kids, but I'm glad I watched it first. I couldn't believe where this movie went. In one early scene, the characters are in a gift shop, and they focus on a rack of mugs shaped like women's naked breasts. In case we didn't notice it, one of the characters picks one up and talks about it. At that point, any chance of my kids seeing this movie went out the window. There are also multiple references to sex with the ape-sidekick Chaka grabbing Friel's breasts. In another scene, Chaka makes hip thrusts to simulate sex. There's also a lot of profanity. So it's definitely not a movie for young kids.

At the same time, it's too silly for adults to enjoy. There's a lot of green-screen and big fake trees that give the movie an unrealistic feel, and the dinosaurs behave in ways that are either too human or too dog-like to take seriously. The comedy is also the literal definition of ""toilet humor."" I lost count of how many times the movie referenced urine and feces. I don't think most of the grown ups who remember this show would be giggling at dinosaur pee and poop jokes. That means it's not really a movie for adults, either.

That leaves a movie which no one will be happy with. If I had been the studio, I would have told them to to go back and either make it more realistic to become a more grownup movie or cut the dirty jokes and make it a movie for kids.

I can sum up the other problem with this movie in two words: Will Farrell. I think they tried to make this movie into ""Anchorman in the Jungle"" instead of ""Land of the Lost."" Most of the movie is about setting up situations where Farrell can be humiliated or scared or hurt, and seeing him running around in ""funny"" ways. I think Will Farrell can be brilliant, but there has to be something for him to work with. This movie throws stuff at him to do that they think will be funny, but often isn't. The movie felt more like a series of connected sketches than a coherent story. Cut to the sketch where Will Farrell covers himself in dinosaur urine. Here's the sketch where Will Farrell has to dance across a volcano to songs from ""A Chorus Line."" He does the best he can, but he can't save the movie on his own.

"So far the system is having lots of crashes with Microsoft Word edition 2013. I am a university student who needs a software that is more reliable. Also Microsoft windows 10 is slower to start when the computer is turned on. when the system is not crashing, writing a academic paper is much efficient until Microsoft and Dragon freezes up and I have to reboot the computer to continue. I will contact customer service and update my rating soon.

after I contacted Amazon customer service I was redirected to a specialist in software installation. Although the Dragon system is not refundable by Amazon, I was content with the customer service that I received. I have uninstalled and installed the software again. The system seems to be working much better. I'm able to dictate an academic paper without having to reboot the computer constantly to get the software unfrozen. Personally the system seems to be working great specially since English is not my native language and attend to have difficulties in writing a academic paper and focusing in my spelling.

"My experience with the webroot package began about 6 months ago when Norton began hanging (failing to finish its scans) on a Windows XP and a Windows Vista computer. I first installed the webroot product on the Windows XP machine and noticed that it always took between 5 - 10 minutes to boot the software up. After several discussions with webroot personnel, I came to the conclusion that this software simply must have a minimum of 1 Gb memory to work properly (the XP machine only had 512K). After upgrading the system memory, there were no further problems. The webroot software worked fine on the Vista machines from the start because they already had sufficient memory.

What you get for your trouble is a very powerful antivirus + anti-spyware combination that is much more adept at finding and eliminating threats than Norton ever was. It is also the first package I've used that effectively stops homepage highjacking, even from the dreaded msn and runonce issues. Just specify the homepage you want in the antivirus program, then in your web browser, reboot, and the problem is gone.

The key here is that you must have 1 Gb of memory for this software to work properly, so if you don't have a full gig or you don't know how much you have, go to [...] where you can scan your computer to see what you have and buy additional memory if needed.

With an afternoon's focus, I got most of the basic functions implemented and felt comfortable using the software.

I normally use it for non-reproduction (i.e. ""lithographic production or ""for printing on a press"") purposes.

I produce a 126 page photo directory of an association once each year. For the last 27 years I had printed from the authoring application (Ventura Publisher) to a Postscript file then having Acrobnat Distiller v8 distill that into a PDF file which was then presented to the service bureau for output.

This year I used this Corel PDF Fusion app. And the plates that came back were unusable. The halftones were far too contrasty (meaning they went full black much too soon and were too light at that end of the scale.)

I compared the plates to the actual tiff images in Photoshop that I have been using for several years with excellent results. The plates were bad, and the only different element was PDF Fusion instead of using Distiller. I remade the files and the differences in the PDFs were obvious. I'll have to eat the cost of 13 plates, several hundred dollars, because PDF Fusion Didn't produce PDFs that were the same as the Gold Standard Distiller.

"This is a review of Office Suite 2006 ... years ago, I purchased this product from a box store (whose name I will not mention) for about $10. It is no longer offered in stores. It offers a word processor that works with Windows most Windows 2003 files. It probably doesn't work well with Windows Office 2007 or Windows Office 2010. It is after all a $10 product (or less).

It is easy to install, and so a very good, basic job for word processing. Which has been our primary use. Without a doubt Word is a much better product. We have also tried the free Open Office (from Sun, which is now owned by Oracle). Open Office is large, and it's word processor while compatible wasn't great or easy to use. The office 2006 suite is very good for very basic word processing needs (kids doing homework, book reports, writing a business letter or resume). Embedding pictures is easy. Cross linking spread sheets, not so easy, I haven't been able to embed dynamic graphs from a spreadsheet to my Office Suite 2006 word processor.

If you are looking for an inexpensive, relatively safe, alternative to $100 for Microsoft Office, this may do. It probably isn't suitable for college level work if that work involves graphs or embedding more than basic .jpg pictures.

We have used the paint program, which is more advanced than the default Microsoft paint that comes with various versions of Windows. It won't handle overlays, won't auto outline, won't allow selection of new backgrounds, basically it isn't Photoshop. If you need to just cut and paste, crop, remove red eye, emboss, change format from one of the many supported types to another, this will work well. Advanced features really aren't included. It's a basic product, but is more capable than the Open Office draw offer from Oracle.

I'm uncertain about licensing, it seems to install on any PC with the same code. I've seen you tube videos offering a code, it is possible there is only one code for all I know.

This is a small, fast, basic suite, for non-advanced users who have basic needs. So far, it has been great for my family.

It cranked away for 3 hours untouched and when the virtual machine started, It was a complete, identical copy of the Windows 7 machine.  Tools installed flawlessly (and automatically).

"Note: I downloaded this piece of uselessness directly from the Wondershare website. My laptop's HD is now 59mb richer for its uninstallation,)

As far as I could determine, this ""data recovery"" software recovers NOTHING you can't find for yourself, especially if you have a competent file-finding program like UltraFileSearch.

I bought it in hope of finding some 100 files I'd accidentally deleted from a camera card before transferring to my hard drive. Wondershare non-Recovery gave me a list of files that hadn't been deleted (they were in a different folder on the card). Otherwise, nada, nothing, nil.  I tried it on all my camera cards -- nothing. I tried every mode of recovery available -- nothing.  I then deleted a document file and a binary data file from my computer as a test. Yes, Wondershare found it. So did the Recycle Bin. So did UltraFileSearch when directed to search system, hidden etc. files -- in the recycle bin. Possibly plain old Windows 8 search would have found it if I'd cared to bother with it.

The trial version, if I remember (no certainty!) lets you use only a few of the ""modes"" of searching. It pulled up a handful of files on a camera card -- files I hadn't realized were still on the card because of an ambiguously named folder. Had I realized this I'd have known better tnan to spend my money.

Don't expect any help from Wondershare. When I uninstalled the program the usual ""help us improve, click on link to send feedback"" screen appeared in my browser. I clicked. This links to the ""support"" screen which adirects you to answer ""these 2 or 3 questions."" Evidently this refers to the three boxes below. One is for the user manual (which you have to buy). One is for ""technical"" and another for more general support questions. These two boxes simply pull up a list of possible issues of the most obvious kind. (I lost my product key. Can I fix a double charge for my download.) Yes, there is a box for other.

Resource use is minimal... and I mean *minimal*. When the program isn't performing an activity, it's almost invisible to system monitors. When it is active, it's still very low-key. I run it on 3 different systems (as allowed by the license), one of which is an old Celeron 800mhz. The old Celeron runs just as well as it did before Norton was installed. The freeware virus scanners I have used on that system (Avast!, AVG) really taxed the meager resources, making a huge performance hit.

The other thing I really like- it's quiet. Norton has decided (rightfully, in my opinion) that the average user doesn't really understand- or *want* to understand- computer security. It therefore makes it's own decisions about system configuration, including when & how to alert the user about virus's or firewall intrusion prevention. The experienced user can still dig into the settings and make the program 'loud', with lot's of messages and warnings. Me, I like the quiet. I kept a very close eye on my systems for the first month, to make sure I was satisfied with how Norton Internet Security 2009 was handling things. Then I forgot about it... the way this stuff is supposed to work.

Two, I do not have the time to spend looking at every feature of a program like this.  Three, there is no matching those professional reviewers and graphic designers that do have that kind of time or use programs like this for so many other features. What I can do is provide why I have liked PSP over the years, and compare it to another tool that I also use... Adobe Lightroom.

What I use Paint Shop programs for:  browsing files of photos and bringing them up for review or fixing.  I am an avid photographer, but also love looking at photo collection sites like Flickr.  File folders often are budging with the photos I like to review in more detail.

The browse function has always been strength of PSP.  It is a nice intuitive interface, with the ability to easily change the size of the thumbnails, and quickly add them to your workspace to review and modify.  Prior versions were slightly different in the way the entire interface was implemented.  The experience between browsing and fixing was a bit more segmented; it lacked a feature that another program defined - workflow.

Lightroom, a true king of ""workflow"", was one of the first PC programs to optimize workflow.  That workflow is how you move from taking a picture and quickly choosing how much work and modification you may want to put into fixing it. Non destructive photo changes allow you to always go back to your originals.  Truly, Lightroom is really super at that.  Even for non-users, they can pick up how a professional photographer might want to work.  Unfortunately, Lightroom is like a BMW.  It can do just about anything, but sometimes you don't need or want all that power or tweak ability.  All of those details can be overwhelming to some users.  Plus, there is a cost of entry.  About $285 right now for the full version. I love Lightroom when I really want delve into a project.  When I just want to look at photos as a group I find myself using Paint Shop.

With workflow, Paint Shop Photo Pro X3, is an improvement over all other prior versions, including X2.  Why?  It is simple--without making X3 look like Lightroom, X3 has made the workflow intuitive without being overly so.  Sure you can reconfigure your workspaces, and the features they contain if you want, but right out of the box, things work in a familiar fashion.  X3 has put some key features, the features I use the most - the ""Organizer"", ""Express Lab"" and ""Full Editor"" in the top right hand corner.  I can open a full view thumbnail view of the folder I want to look at, reorder it (personally, by date taken), and easily open that photo in the workspace to then see what I can do in Express Lab or Full Editor.  Express Lab brings back those one step or ""Smart Photo"" fixes that are most common.  Everything works like before, and the workflow is more integrated.

The normal cropping, magnification, and straighten tools are all where they have been in the past, and as before you can add or remove anything you do not want hanging out.

Editing functions, especially contrast and color control, seem to be clean and not introduce an undue amount of processing noise.  Anytime you fix a photo, you need to be careful to not introduce an undue amount of noise into the photo.  Doing photo work is like a cassette tape.  The more you listen to it, the more fidelity from the original is lost.  That is why it is important to save originals and fixed versions separately.  It is also the reason that many people work from RAW photos, because even the digital camera you use is typically storing and processing pictures in a compressed format like jpeg.

I also enjoy using plug-ins for doing artistic work (pseudo painting), and having some proprietary filters in place.  Filters can be very helpful because some professional has already tweaked a variety of settings that usually are not obvious or available in any given program.  These types of plug-ins were easy to install and use in X3.

Can a person who has never used any program like this before pick it up and start using it right away to browse and fix photos?  I would say yes.  These features are easily understood and the help files attached to them are easy to understand.  Is Paint Shop Photo Pro X3 recommended over all prior versions?  I would say if you have anything before X2, X3 is worth it.  If you have X2, X3 is worth the upgrade.  If you are considering more expensive programs like Lightroom, and have never used any comprehensive programs like Paint Shop (Pro), then I would start with Paint Shop Photo Pro X3.  The price difference is just too great, and X3 provides a lot of value and features for the money.

Previous Review >Now, I can appreciate the effort Intuit goes through to improve their QB products and 2015 looks like a nice set of refinements and features. But there's one thing that has stopped me in my tracks from upgrading. Time Sheets lost the ability to sort by Customer:Job after the R3 update to QB 2014.

The worst decision an Intuit Quickbooks product manager has ever made was the change made in QB 2014 R3. When viewing a previously saved weekly timesheet, the time entries will remain in the ""order in which they were originally entered"" rather than sorted A-Z by Customer:Job.

Why in the world would they make a change like this with out leaving a way to have time sheets function the way they have for 10+ years? This alone may be the reason that I NEVER buy another QB release. And by the way, they tried this for a brief moment with QB2013 R7 and quickly reverted after bad feedback. Really seems like a simple fix - just make the columns sortable by just clicking the column heading like in databases.",UPDATED - I can appreciate the effort Intuit goes through to improve their QB products,True,1414195200,2.8903717578961645,1.0

"First, where did all of the reviews of this product go? Last time I checked the number was large and the consensus was fairly negative.

With Mac sales up and MS always paranoid, did MS decide that the Mac version of Office could be released with reduced features and more bugs than usual? This software reminds me of what we endured the darkest days of Apple hardware/software in the mid-90s. As examples of feature cuts, Excel 2008 has neither Solver nor any of the analysis add-ins. Fairly simple operations in Excel, such as drawing a graph, sometimes now involve a substantial amount of time to complete. I can't recall the last time that attempting to draw a simple scatterplot produced a warning that due to the ""complexity"" of the graph, I might experience a long wait. Similar operations were essentially instantaneous in the 2004 version.

The only thing I have found to like about the new Excel is the increase in the number of cells in the spreadsheet.

In Word, as in the bad old days, simply scrolling is an adventure. The screen does not re-draw correctly even in a short document with simple formatting. Be careful about scrolling and then deleting. You may be very surprised by which portion of text disappears.

"I sell raw materials to industry for a living, and my (otherwise great) company doesn't provide any kind of contact management/sales tools for the sales force. One the hand hand, it's very frustrating not to have a ""go-to"" tool for my everyday tasks. On the other hand, they don't give me much opposition to devising my own tools that work the way I want them to.

I have done the ""use Excel as a database"" thing for a year now, as many professionals do, and it's awkward at best. Excel was never meant to be a database, we all know that. And FileMaker, as powerful as it is, requires that you already be pretty savvy at devising databases to actually get it to do the things that you want, the way you want. I don't have time to learn not only how to use a completely new piece of software, but actually how to set it up and program it, too. I might as well just change jobs and find work as a database engineer!

SO, my research turned up Bento. Based on my reading, I was doubtful that Bento would be able to do everything I needed, but I thought for $49, if it did half of what I needed, it would be still be a good buy. In use, Bento is a joy - the design templates are very easy to set up (if somewhat limited in choice, but again, it's supposed to be a quick and easy setup, so offering too many starting points would be counterintuitive), and setting up your fields and libraries is so intuitive that it's doubtful you will need to read the manual for much more than an occasional reference.

Usage templates are included for home inventories, project management, pretty much anything you would use a simple database for. Since I'm trying to get some more sophistication out of it, none of the templates  really offered me anything except some learning reference, so I had to start from scratch.

Having spent a week with it now, I will say that, for $49, and given how it is advertised, Bento is a no-brainer. It is a fantastically well-executed simple database and a joy to use. For importing your iCal events and address book contacts and pretty powerful contact management capabilities, it would be worth the $49 alone.

But since I had hoped to use it for a few other tasks, I came across its three key weaknesses. Again, it is unfair to blame something for not being what the producers don't claim that it is in the first place, but the price/performance point is a heartbreaker. I would have paid $79 or $99 (actually, I would have paid $199 given how valuable it could be to me) if the three main weaknesses could be addressed. For anyone interested or considering using it professionally, here they are:

1. The ""calculation"" field option is limited to simple math. Field entries using calculations can be interactive, of course, but they cannot accept an additive command entry (e.g. take the entry and make the change permanent in the database until I enter something new in the field, but also not lose the previous entry's value in the database).

I'll explain: the raw materials that I sell are subject to market volatility (e.g the price changes almost every day). I had hoped to be able to create a library of raw materials that I sell with important info about each one - which I can - but I wanted to create a ""net price change since yesterday"" field that would take my simple price change entry, then distribute that change throughout the database for each customer to whom I am quoting/selling that material. I could then start my morning with my change notification emails, make the changes in the database in 5-10 minutes, then create a contacts list of customers affected by the changes and send mass emails to notify them quickly. What normally takes hours in my day could be reduced to about 10-15 minutes.

Since the calculation possibilities for such a field do not allow additive entry, that means that any change that I make will be absolute in the database, not additive. If I add 5 cents/pound to a price today, fine, but if I try to add an additional 3 cents/pound tomorrow, it will just take the 3 cents, erase the 5 cents from yesterday, and distribute 3 cents throughout the database. So it's useless as a pricing monitor. Not that it matters, anyway, because...

2. Data interactivity between libraries is limited to simple importing/exporting of data in table form (called ""related fields"" in Bento nomenclature). Within any given library, you can specify a data import field from any other library, and the data will remain interactive of course, but you're stuck with the same import parameters for each record in the new library. I quote different customers different prices for the same materials based on volumes, freight differences, etc. Even if my materials library could accept an additive price change command, there would be no way to program the database to know how to distribute that mathematical information differently to different customer records. Bento's import fields option is clearly designed to import contact info for project management so that you can, for example, see contact info for everyone working on a project on the same screen without having to switch to your Address Book or Address Book library in Bento and search blindly. Cool feature for what it is, just not very sophisticated.

3. While setting up your database, you can duplicate fields and forms, but you cannot duplicate libraries. Since I track information in similar ways for customers, materials, and projects, it would have been great to set up one, use it as a template, and duplicate & tweak as necessary. Instead, I had to go through a labor-intensive process to get each of my libraries set up.

Bento will undoubtedly prove useful and time-saving to me. Although it was not able to do the one REALLY time saving thing that I had hoped, it can do pretty much everything else for my contact management, including:

1. Track sales by customer, volume, total $, net $, and any combination thereof.
2. Manage short and long term projects
3. Track problem matters and ensure up-to-date info on resolution.

You can, of course, do these tasks any any other number of ways, but Bento provides a way to do it all in one piece of software, on one screen. I pray that next year they will offer a $49 upgrade to ""Bento Pro"" or something that will allow the other tasks I really need. I actually could get my work week under 40 hours with that and still get everything done!","For $49, great database...for $99 it could be AWESOME",False,1217808000,1.791759469228055,0.0

It still is really a Windows 95 application, and gleefully writes all over the application directory (C:\Program Files\Quicken) every time it starts up.
If you have user accounts on Windows 2000 that are ""Restricted User"" (in the Users group), the software will not run out-of-the-box.  You will have to modify the security on the application directory to add Modify and Write permissions for the Users group.  This, of course, means that any virus that gets into your computer can attack and infest any file that is part of Quicken.
Having the application directory be writeable was not ""safe computing"" when Intuit wrote Quicken many years ago, and it is not ""safe computing"" now.  Microsoft guidelines have you store all state under the user account in C:\Documents and Settings.  It is telling that Quicken does NOT have any ""Windows logo"" certification from Microsoft.  Maybe Quicken doesn't trust Microsoft not to show the new version to the Microsoft Money people, but Intuit also must know that it would flunk the certification process horribly!

"Instant Immersion Spanish Deluxe is an enigma. Clearly significant development effort was devoted to the original application framework. However, there are so many problems with the application in its current form, it appears that there were either two development groups (i.e. the company or the intellectual property was acquired) with a disjointed development process or the company ran out of money during the development process.

While there are some gee wiz features, such an avatar that shows proper lip movements for various words, the program is very poorly designed. There is a calendar and task lists that supposedly coach the user through his or her progression. Yet the tasks jump around in difficultly without proper repetition and with no continuity between steps.

Other problems include the fundamental content. In some of the question and answer modules, the pictures do not correspond to clear answers. In other words, there would be a very basic scene and three potential answers written in Spanish for which it is not clear, even with the English translations, what a ""correct"" answer would be.

In summary, Instant Immersion Spanish has myriad content that should be displayed in a completely redesigned interface with improved progression of the material.

Cons (notice how Cons comes before Pros)

1)Hard to navigate

2)Material difficulty doesn't follow a clear pattern

3)Oddly vague answers to specific questions

4)Can't copy the program to disk requiring the reliance on the five CDs

Pros

1)Good audio CD's (three separate audio disks)

2)Advanced content (mixing audio and video; avatar)",Needs a Complete Redesign,False,1110326400,3.258096538021482,0.0

Office 2013, on the other hand, crawls on the same laptop that ran Office 2010 perfectly fine (Core 2 Duo P8400 2.26 GHz, 4GB DDR3). Office 2013 also has visual improvements that slow down Excel to the point I am waiting for my cursor to move over after using the arrow keys about 10 seconds ago. Shutting off the visual improvements helps, but it takes an extra 3-5 seconds to open up Office applications or files. Outlook 2013 is even slower.

The cool aspect of Office 2013 is that the applications have a more simplified look and feel, but that is about it. I see no benefit to upgrade 2010 to 2013, and I actually had 3 more licenses that I could use but won't be upgrading all of my computers after evaluating 2013 on my main computer.

Lotus SmartSuite has all the programs a standard program suite should have: word processor, drawing program, spreadsheet, data base, and time manager. (And a couple others, I think)  I can't quite grok the database program, Access, which is unusual for me, but maybe I haven't tried.  Not too many people set up databases especially since a good spreadsheet program can work like one and data entry is much faster in a spreadsheet.

Word Pro is my preferred private writing program. For one thing, there aren't many other programs that can read the *.lwp files.  There are other formats that you can save your document in, even the standard *.doc format from you know who.

The spreadsheet program is an oldie but goody.  I started on Lotus 123 v. 1, on either the original IBM PC or the XT.  That was a few years ago.  And once you know what one spreadsheet has, most of the others just take a little time to get used to them.

The time management program is rather neat.  It is set up like a physical, in the hand, organizer with a calendar, contacts, notepad, and to do list. These are the ones I have used.

They resolved the issue by having me switch ends of the transfer cable, which has NO MARKINGS to indicate that it makes any difference which way it is connected.  After several tries the transfer worked.  14 hours later it was done.  I then started to explore the new computer to find that almost none of the transferred software worked.

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling several applications to find that they would not work at all because PCMover had changed OS settings.  I talked with tech support for several software apps and they could not understand why they wouldn't work.

I had to choose between accepting the cloud data or my desktop's. I chose my desktops because I knew it was correct. I then had to keep signing into the cloud, creating a cloud account I had already created and finally it synced. All was well until I went back to my netbook and synced that. It wouldn't sync telling me that the cloud data file was different to my netbooks! Well of course it was, but why couldn't it just sync it and update the netbook? I've no idea.

Then I got Win XP and found that it still worked, except for a few things it would not do.  I contacted MS about downloads to help me use it with XP.  I was told that the program is no longer available and could not be upgraded to use on XP.  So I used as much of it as I could until I got Win Vista.

The only problem is that these features have long been available for Microsoft products such as Works, Word, Excel and Access.

So far, I love it.  Granted, I haven't had it for all that long, but I believe I will be happy with it.

I haven't had any issues with installation.  It installed with no problems at all.  I haven't had any of the other problems I've read about in other reviews.

The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was that it took me what seemed like forever to find one of the features I was looking for (one of the more important ones, to me).

I had to reinstall all my software.  Yeah, that was fun.  Most of my software was not compatible so I had to go online to download the newest drivers.  That was not a problem.  I got everything I needed, EXCEPT PAPERPORT!  I could not get an update to paperport because it was bundled with the printer software.  So I was able to get the newest driver for the printer, but not an update for paperport.

The version of paperport that comes bundled with the printer (at least the version I received), is much different from this version.  This version has a LOT MORE to it!  It looks much better, too.

PROS: Seamless backup to desktop Quicken; useful budget feature; integrated calculator.
CONS: No uncategorized items permitted in split transactions; inability to edit (on handheld) any transaction backed up to desktop Quicken; quirky installation procedure.
Like many others, a determining factor in purchasing a handheld organiser was the potential of managing my finances `on the go'. With so many poor reviews of Pocket Quicken 1.0, it was an easy decision to go with Pocket Money, which worked well. The missing piece was easy backup and importing to the desktop version of Intuit Quicken or Microsoft Money.
Quicken can import a .qif file (containing several accounts) generated from Pocket Money. The trouble I had was importing transfer transactions: they were duplicated and/or adjusted, requiring re-reconciliation. To work with Microsoft Money, you had to create a .qif file for every account in Pocket Money. Quickly annoying with over 20 accounts, required on every synchronisation.
Pocket Quicken 2.0 does what it claims here: flawless synchronisation between handheld and desktop. However, it is one-way only; once transactions are uploaded to the desktop, you can't edit them on the handheld.
Worse, every cent/pence must be assigned to a category in Pocket Quicken. Do the programmers at LandWare not use cash? You withdraw cash from an ATM/hole-in-the-wall; you spend some of it now, some of it later. Well, if you record the transaction in Pocket Quicken, you either have to (a) wait until it is all spent before entering appropriate categories in your split transaction, or (b) enter the split transaction with a large segment categorised as `Misc', then constantly adjust this figure as you spent the rest of the cash. At least on desktop Quicken you can override the `uncategorised items' warning. Sort this out quick, please.
The installation procedure is also quirky. Here is how I managed it: (1) Install desktop Quicken. NB: Set-up password (go to File: Passwords: File); (2) Install Pocket Quicken; (3) Conduct first Palm synchronisation; (4) Open Pocket Quicken; (5) Enter desktop Quicken password in box `Quicken File Password' (leave `Launch PIN' = `-Unassigned-` unless you desire a PIN for Pocket Quicken); (6) Conduct second Palm synchronisation; (7) NB: Conduct future Palm synchronisation with desktop Quicken CLOSED.
Not all is bad news. Pocket Quicken's budget feature is competitively unique, and I find it very useful. Yet if the folks at LandWare can manage to synchronise category lists, why not budgets?
The integrated calculator is a convenient piece of programming. Just wish as much thought went into the rest of the package.
Overall, Pocket Quicken 2.0 is undoubtedly an improvement over version 1.0. Its (one-way) synchronisation is truly seamless, and its budget feature is unmatched. However, major improvements are still required. In the end, I could justify the purchase, with my many accounts and long transaction history. Though I expect some free upgrades from LandWare. I have to say, if you only rely on your handheld, then Pocket Money is likely to be a better experience.","Seamless synchronisation, but major improvements required",False,1035504000,3.258096538021482,0.0
"I've been working for a print shop for around three years now, and have been doing computer aided design work for about 7 years now and I must say that Quark is simply the best in desktop publishing software there is, well worth the extra money over PageMaker, InDesign, and the very very sad Publisher.
Sure, Quark isn't quite as friendly as PageMaker, but there is a reason for that.  Quark works on logic as opposed to trying to be ""friendly"".  Quark was obviously designed by people who were actually layout artists before the days of computerized design, and it shows.  The layout looks exactly like what you would see on an old mock-up.
Granted this means you have to know a bit about layout and design, but you get much better results, and the pre press department at the printer will love you if you use Quark correctly.  PageMaker and InDesign are clunky and a bit obnoxious to deal with.

"I've had this disc for 10 years.  I recently noticed that the Microsoft version of Klondike called Solitaire has a poor random deal generator.  I spotted repeating patterns after playing a few dozen games.  So I dug out my Ultimate Solitaire by Valusoft and began playing Klondike.  Within a few dozen games I again spotted repeating patterns.  I am guessing but I think both Microsoft and Valusoft use a random number generator in the operating system and either neither of them know how to increase the randomness or neither company knows how to write its own random number generator.  I suspect that all of Valusoft's solitaire games use the same random number generator, thus all of the games suffer from the same lack of random shuffles of the cards.  The games are fun but don't expect the shuffles to ""always"" give you a different game.  But there are a lot of games and it will take you a long time to try them all.

"Hero Lab is a great program for creating role playing characters. The system has tremendous flexibility for adding stats, gear, spells, and talents/skills unique to the game system you choose. But that choice is the one major ""con"" for this product - while the package and product description tout all of the different systems you can use (d20/3.5, pathfinder, D&D 4.0, etc.), you only get to choose ONE product with the included license and everything else costs additional money.

So if you are playing both 3.5 and 4.0 D&D, you will buy the product and at least another $20 in license fees. And Pathfinder is the worst of them all - every additional hardcover book (like the Advanced Player's Guide or the Beastiaries) costs anywhere from $10 to $20 extra to add to your Pathfinder license.

The verification process is a great feature that draws your attention to everything required to ""complete"" the character, such as adding feats when you have leveled.

If you do not play multiple systems or need the add-ons, Hero Lab is a great deal and I heavily recommend it to any RPers who want character generation/printing ease.

"I have been using Quicken for years and have learned that new is not always better.  The last update to 2011 gave me a fairly stable program although its validation process continues to yield issues, regardless of the fact that the ""problems"" it recognizes are because of reconciled transactions NOT carried over on a year end copy.

Along comes 2012.  I admit, I am an early adopter, expecting (naively so) a better product than the one it replaces.  Little did I realize that the new product would stink.  I have been doing online banking and online bookkeeping for years, all the way back to the early days of Tobias Managing Your Money.

Simply put, DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM.  It is not ready for prime time and errors galore.  Updating one's portfolio is so filled with bugs that it is a guarantee to cause entry errors.

Some examples.  I have six different accounts.  Yes it goes online and updates each.  However, press the ""accept"" button leads to a dead end and doesn't take you to the next transaction.  It also doesn't know when all transactions are complete for the downloaded account.  The workaround is clicking on an earlier transaction on the transaction list and going back to enter the next transaction and so on.

It also keeps downloading with EVERY portfolio transaction ""Splits"" that I have already taken care of and no matter how many times I try to eliminate it, it comes back with each successive download.  Finally I accepted the download and had to find where it inserted the splits deep in the bowels of the transactions and eliminate my entered one and left theirs, a tiresome and potentially error ridden process.

It is clearly slower than 2011, providing NO benefit and nothing but additional hassles.

This is the first time I have ever done this, BUT, I got a refund and am have gone back to 2011.

H&R Pros

Significantly less glitch prone than 2010 Software
Easy Step By Step ""in plain English"" instructions for most sections
Explanations of what each section does
Explanations about what has changed from the previous year
Auto-loads all information from the previous version
""Risk Monitor"" gives you peace of mind when you're done
5 Free federal uploads

H&R Cons:

Lower federal return amount than last year
Poor explanation of what can be deducted in the state section
Very little guidance through sub sections that deal with specific lists
In the final stages the software will ""loop"" continuously when it gets to the state return

Overall I'd say that H&R is easier and more user friendly. TurboTax is more thorough, but less user friendly, and has far more glitches. (I had to re-submit last year with TurboTax).

What's worse, it's actually not possible to correct it without going into the tax forms during the accuracy review and overriding the incorrect entry.  So, even if I wanted to pay $20 to e-file this state, I can't anymore.  I called their support line and alerted them of the bug, gave them a reproduction and explained to them how to fix it.  I told them that I wanted my money back under their ""Maximum Return Guarantee"" and they said they had to escalate to a manager to dispense it.  I'm looking forward to seeing whether their ""guarantee"" is for real or just a bunch of hot air.

"This is a so-so product.  The ancestry product is really 50% the software tools and 50% the online ancestry.com access that membership provides.  Without online access, you are just twiddling your thumbs.

The product does what you intend.  It is pretty easy to create a family tree and do research.  However, it does have its quirks.

For example, the program is great if you don't make any errors.  However, what do you do if you accidently ""skip"" a generation or go off in the wrong direction for a couple generations.  How do you fix that?  Good question.  I sure as heck never figured it out.  That's not to say that there isn't a solution - it just isn't readily apparent.  I resorted to making several smaller trees versus on large tree given the risk of making an error.

Also, the online search resources really aren't that good.  Yes, you can eventually find what you are looking for, but it takes awhile.  A typical internet search engine does a better job.  I've run searches for people I know exist, but I can't find them - it is not that they aren't in the database... it's that the database won't always produce a result unless you search a certain way.  The details aren't important... If you work enough with the online resource you will see what I mean.

I thought maybe my family was descended from silverback gorillas, but I couldn't validate that.  You see, my dad has a fairly hairy back and I figured it probably came from a gorilla ancestor.  Oh well... maybe it was a chimp...

The downfall of the ancestry products is the amount of garbage genealogy available online.  Ancestry.com has become the Facebook of family trees.  Anyone can post any tree they want in the public trees section and there is no verification.  I'm not suggesting there could be or should be, but the public trees are full or garbage.

People shouldn't be surprised that you can find them online... they should be disturbed how much of their personal information they choose to post online.

2:06 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Can I see that order from Amazon?
2:07 PM Penelope Carpenter: There you go.
2:10 PM SACHIN GUPTA: You received an invalid key error because your product key can only be used to activate a product in the geographic region it was intended for.
2:11 PM Penelope Carpenter: How am I to know that? Just what is that region?
2:11 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Actually each Norton product is prepared to be used in a specific region and you got a product which should be used in some other region.

2:12 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I request you to contact Amazon customer care.
2:12 PM SACHIN GUPTA: And they will definitely help you in this.
2:12 PM Penelope Carpenter: I need you to intermediate.
2:12 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Please wait.
2:15 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Penelope, I apologize for that as it is a third party issue and Amazon can help you in this regard only.
2:16 PM Penelope Carpenter: Who is your channel marketing director????
2:17 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I can understand what you are feeling this time but we are helpless. I hope you can understand this.
2:17 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I request you to purchase Norton product from our website only in future.
2:17 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Amazon people will definitely help you in this. Please try to reach them once.
2:19 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Can you do that?
2:21 PM Penelope Carpenter: Norton charges almost 3X the money and obviously does not provide customer support, so it would move me to change products in the future. Very disappointed in the policy.
2:22 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you. If you want I can provide you an offer.
2:24 PM Penelope Carpenter: In going over the reviews on Amazon, I am not the first person this has happened to. I had hoped Symantec had resolved the hole in it's customer service regarding this issue by contacting your customer service directly. I received the prodcut via mail order and have no way of knowing if the product was meant for California or China. It seems to be a sales department problem with their 3rd party vendor. Therefore I am requesting Symantec resolve it for me quickly.
2:24 PM SACHIN GUPTA: We cannot do anything in this regard but if you purchase Norton from our website this time, we will provide you 6 months free subscription in it so that it can compensate your charge to some extent. Is it fine with you?
2:25 PM Penelope Carpenter: To put it simply, the 3rd party vendor would not have it to sell if Symantec had not sold it to them in the first place.
2:25 PM Penelope Carpenter: No. That is not a resolution that will work for me.
2:25 PM Penelope Carpenter: I have already spent the money on the first copy.
2:26 PM Penelope Carpenter: I do not have $90 today to do so.
2:27 PM Penelope Carpenter: I simply want Symantec to provide a working product key for my purchase.
2:28 PM Penelope Carpenter: My purchase was made in good faith from a large vendor supplied by Symantec. I do not understand why this is an issue.
2:29 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Please do not worry.
2:30 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Please allow me a minute.

2:31 PM SACHIN GUPTA: You are welcome.
2:31 PM SACHIN GUPTA: As you have purchased the Norton product from Amazon, so, I would request you to contact them.
2:32 PM SACHIN GUPTA: I am 100% sure that they will replace the product key.
2:32 PM Penelope Carpenter: I do not want to have to go through a 3rd party return process. It is one of Amazon's vendors that did this.
2:33 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Amazon is not our vendor.
2:34 PM Penelope Carpenter: Then how can they supply our product? Software Quick is the actual vendor listed. I let you look at my order. Did you see that?
2:34 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Yes, I do.
2:35 PM Penelope Carpenter: I worked for Software Re-Sellers before and they would have had to purchase the product from Syamantec at some point for it to be a legal licensed copy.
2:35 PM Penelope Carpenter: So your claim that it is not your vendor does not seem logical.
2:35 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Please contact Amazon for the change of the product key. I am sure that they will exchange the product key. Please ask them to change the product key and they will surely do it.
2:36 PM Penelope Carpenter: I would like to speak to a supervisor at Symantec.
2:38 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Sure. I would strictly recommend you to buy Norton 360 directly from us. If you would have purchased Norton product from us, we have provided the another product key of this Norton product.
2:39 PM Penelope Carpenter: I've always bought it online, from Costco, and Amazon (all 3rd party providers!) and have never had this issue. Do not scold me.
2:39 PM SACHIN GUPTA: Now, in this case, I would request you to contact Amazon so that they can provide you a another product key. If in case, if they do not provide the product key, please contact us back with the same case id.
2:39 PM Penelope Carpenter: I am requesting your supervisor for the 2nd time. Please have them contact me.

"I've been an all time Windows user, working with all Windows flavors from Windows 3.1 (oh, those days!) to the new resource-hungry Vista. My only previous experience with Linux was around year 2000 with RedHat, and back then I wasn't impressed. But Linux have changed a lot (evolved, really) since then.

Last month a friend of mine showed me Ubuntu, and I was intrigued enough to try it out on my home PC. I'm glad I did. Installation was smooth, fast, and even easier than installing Windows.

(BTW, the installer does not touch your Windows installation. It's smart enough to make room for the new OS in the HD and after installing and rebooting, you have the choice of booting up with Ubuntu or with Windows. It's called a dual-boot configuration. However a backup of your important files is in order, of course.)

And the Ubuntu OS is awesome! It can do everything Windows can in a fun, easy, powerful way. Ubuntu opened my eyes to the new Linux world, and it's a bright, fantastic world. For starters, it's great to be free of Antivirus / Antyspyware software slowing down my system. You can immediately start to browse the net, configure your e-mail client, add / remove software and install OS updates automatically (the Synaptic package manager is amazing, much better than Windows ""Add/Remove Program"" applet.) You have Office, CD/DVD Burner, Multimedia players, and instant access to thousand of software titles you can use for free. All of them can be installed/uninstalled in a second.

So now I find myself using MS Windows less and less. Ubuntu GUI (it's called GNOME) is  so easy to use I might stop caring about Windows completely in the future. Admittedly, I am a computer savvy person, so for the average user I recommend reading the Ubuntu Guide and/or ordering the Ubuntu book here on Amazon. The Ubuntu guide it's oriented towards new users, clearly written, and it shows you how to do all sort of things in Ubuntu.

When you upload a song already on the server it decides to use that one instead to limit the amount of songs that need to be uploaded.
Smart, if it actually works, the app proceeded to have some kind of ""conflict"" and ends up with duplicates of the song that you cannot delete out of the display list.

Somehow the app was unable to find a song by name. After looking for the album instead I still could not sort the window on song names, the option is simply not there. Creating a playlist of songs makes the app upload ALL the songs in the album even if only one song is selected. I am starting to wonder if this is by design.

"What a big lie!

Received Intuit GM Sasan Goodarzi's email below trying to explain away the reasons for their significant change in what's included in their product. At least be honest Sasan and state the obvious that greater profitability was at least partially in mind! Claiming they are removing standard schedules historically included with purchase to ""make it easier for me to choose the right product"" is outrageous. We're not stupid! My guess is you figured anyone itemizing (schedule C) would be able to pay more and anyone with stock sales (schedule D) or rentals (schedule E) even more still. If you had at least come forward and stated part of your decision was around profits I would have respected you more.

I have been purchasing Turbotax for 20 years every year. Plus I've used Quicken for longer than that. Now they want to double what I have to spend every year plus have gone about it in a very sneaky way. The email says nothing about going forward in 2015 so I assume we'll be back to this same game again. So what if I go through hoops and get my $25 rebate this year when I may be in the same boat next tax season.  Not for me...I'm switching to H&R Block's product unless a more permanent option is proposed.

Too late too little Sasan!

EMAIL FROM SASAN GOODARZI, GM Intuit:

We messed up. We made a change this year to TurboTax desktop software and we didn't do enough to communicate this change to you as proactively and broadly as we could or should have. I am very sorry for the anger and frustration we may have caused you.

Intuit has a long history of doing right by our customers, and in this instance, we did not live up to the standards of excellence you have come to expect from us. We did not handle this change in a manner that respected our loyal customers and we owe you an explanation of what we are doing to make it right. The change we made to our desktop products, both the download and CD versions, includes removing Schedules C, D, E and F from TurboTax Deluxe, which some long-time customers had relied on to report business income, investment sales and rental property income. As a result, you may now be required to upgrade the version of TurboTax you use even though your tax situation hasn't changed from last year.

Here's why we made the change. Over the years, we have worked hard to make it easy for you to choose the TurboTax product that is right for you and your unique tax situation. We want that choice to be clear and confidence inspiring. However, as new online and mobile technologies emerged, our products, and the tax scope and features they included, began to differ, leading to customer confusion. These differences also impeded our ability to introduce new innovations across our entire product line.

So this year, we made the product experience consistent across all TurboTax offerings. This change enables us to innovate faster and make improvements that benefit all customers at the same time, regardless of whether they use our online or desktop software. You can be sure that we've preserved what's unique to our desktop product: the ability to e-file up to five returns, switch to forms mode and install the software on multiple computers. Find the TurboTax product that's right for you.

  But good intent must be matched with great execution, and that is where we let you down. We have heard from many of you that you were surprised when you discovered the change. No one likes this kind of a surprise, so we are taking immediate action to make things right and help you through this transition year.

  We are giving $25 back if you purchased TurboTax Deluxe desktop software (CD or download) and filed your 2013 tax return and have to upgrade to TurboTax Premier or Home & Business to file your 2014 return. This will help you move to the right desktop product, while reducing the immediate and unexpected financial impact. After completing and filing your return this year, request your $25 here.

  I deeply regret the anger and distress we have caused those of you affected by this change. Our customers are the heartbeat of every TurboTax employee. Our hope is that we can regain your trust and demonstrate that our commitment to you has never been stronger.

  Sincerely,

  Sasan Goodarzi and the TurboTax Team

"I have two name brand VHS/DVD recorder/players.
While trying to burn several home movies I rec'd the ""copy protect message"" and the units stopped.
I decided to do some homework - here is what I found

1- When filming, if you used a camera with macrovision, (the copy protect magnetic strip device that is recorded onto the tape as required by law due to bootleg movies and such), you may be limited to copying the contents one time only - or maybe not at all.

2- If your VHS tapes are really starting to age, you may also get the copy protect message even if macrovision was not used.

"Before I write my review, I would like to note that I have had one semester of Mandarin Chinese, so I am familiar with some of the most basic words and phrases.  I am using Rosetta Stone in addition to my Chinese classes so that I will learn to speak better and be able to listen to Chinese on a regular basis outside of class.

I read the User's Guide before -- and while -- using Rosetta Stone.  The program is not 100% user-friendly, so I needed the User's Guide to find out how to get started in the program, how to put the program in test mode, how to view my test scores, etc.

It is very easy after you read the user's guide and play around with the program for a little while to figure everything out.  You can select ""preview"" to see and hear what you will be learning, ""guided exercise"" to be taken through the lesson automatically, or go through the numbered exercises one by one.

With most exercises, you hear a description and/or see a photograph, and you have to match up the description and/or photo with one of four answer choices.  Depending on the exercise you do, you will have to recognize characters, spoken words, or both.

There are three options for reading and writing text:  Pinyin, simplified, and traditional characters.  These are on the lower right of the screen.  I am using traditional characters in my classes, so I always select the traditional characters option.

There seems to be a lot of confusion among reviewers about the writing section.  On my CD, there are four different types of exercises you can do in writing:  Two exercises allow for pinyin only and the other two allow for pinyin, simplified, or traditional characters.

Traditional and simplified characters can be entered into a text box using the drag-and-drop method.  If you use pinyin in writing, you have to make rather awkward tone mark selections and get them over the right letter or your answer is wrong.  Although some people would claim pinyin is easier than characters, in Rosetta Stone it is infinitely easier to memorize characters due to the constant repetition of phrases than it is to remember where the tone marks go in pinyin.

The Curriculum Text so far is of no use to me at all, and appears to be in pinyin and simplified characters only (which is no good for someone trying to learn traditional characters).  You don't even really need it to proceed with the lessons, anyway.

The speaking portion is not working out entirely well for me, personally.  You need a USB headset to record your voice in order to compare it to the native speaker's.  I have to speak at an unnaturally-loud level to record anything at all, and I have to speak with constant force in my voice or the program stops recording me.  I never get my reply to match the intensity of the speaker's, even with the microphone directly in front of my mouth and me speaking very loudly into it (just below shouting level).  This could be my problem, though.  Although I don't ever match the speaker's voice, it is good for practice to be able to hear the comparisons between my pronunciation and the speaker's.

I haven't needed to use customer support for anything so I can't comment on that and installation was easy.

"Let me start off by saying that this is by no means a bad software package. I gave it an overall 3 stars because it is middle-of-the-road. That middle-of-the-road is its primary flaw.

I'm an advanced user. I've used software like Photoshop for years to create digital paintings, texture maps as well as to perform intensive photo editing on assets for films and interactive software. Serif PhotoPlus X4 offers a host of photo editing tools while stripping away a lot of the non-photo editing options contained in the more expensive suites like Photoshop. The software knows its purpose and performs it well.

The only criticism I have for it is that it's a little too specific. Professional photographers and design studios are going to want the extra bells and whistles that the full blown, industry standard, software packages provide. They are not in the market for a $25-$50 software package that only satisfies their basic photo-editing needs. The amateur photographer can easily perform a google search and find several reputable free-ware software packages that offer the same tools found in here.

So who is this software for? The only demographic that I really see showing an interest would be the semi-professional starting up their own business with limited funding. However, depending on their success, they will probably be making the upgrade to more powerful and full-featured software packages within a year or so. As I mentioned, this isn't bad software, it just doesn't really have its place.","Not Deep Enough for the Professional, Not Cheap Enough for the Amateur.",False,1338076800,0.0,0.0

"My 100-user organization had Symantec Client Security 1.0 for two years. Had various problems including:
- infections with suspicious processes that caused obvious problems for users, yet Symantec reported no virus.
- twice, LiveUpdate imported new firewall policies that stopped a business-critical Access/SQL Server application from working until new firewall policies were deployed.
- the firewall recently started acting erratically and had to be uninstalled from many workstations.
- the products causes a very noticeable performance hit, really bad during scheduled scans.

Since there was no more support for our 1.0 version, I convinced the CFO to buy version 3.0. The server migration failed without explanation and wiped out our 1.0 server configuration.

The online technical forum is not well supported - it looks like 5% of questions placed in the last month got any answers. It took another day after I registered for support to finally get a phone number to call. Then two hours on the phone and multiple downloads of components and tools still yielded no clues why the installation failed.

"Hello friends..

If you are going to purchase Poser Pro as a digital download from Amazon, it's a great program, however, there's something that will save yourself a lot of trouble in the initial installation.

I didn't really see anything on any type of ""read me"" files that came with my download. If these instructions are there, then I clearly missed them.

However, I'd like to make it easy for people who are downloading this software, to save themselves the trouble I was able to eventually figure out.

I don't know if this is the same thing as when you download directly from Poser's ""Smith Micro's"" website, but if it does the same with those download packages, then hopefully through some word search, you've found this solution and it likewise works for you.

Before we begin, there's a quick 4 step process listed below all this much more detailed version of what to do and the explanation of this problem. If you're pretty computer savvy and not too interested in what's going on, just go to the bottom and read the 4 steps of instructions there.

For those more interested in the detail, here's what kept happening to me.

I purchased the downloadable version of Poser Pro 2012 from Amazon.com. I began my download, using the amazon poser pro downloader that takes a few mins to download, and that upon running, starts the actual download of Poser. Prepare to allow the better part of the whole day to download this program as Poser is quite sizable.

For me it automatically set up a folder for all the zipped / downloaded files to go to on my desktop.

**********HERE'S WHERE I WILL SAVE YOU A LOT OF TROUBLE**********

After a whole day or so of downloading, you now have that folder that automatically set up on your desktop sitting there.

Your first step is to UNZIP / EXPAND / EXTRACT, (however you want to say it) all the zipped folders. If I'm not mistaken, there should be 9 of them, and they are as follows:

PoserPro2012Animals
PoserPro2012CartoonFantasyFigures
PoserPro2012Clothing
PoserPro2012Hair
PoserPro2012Installer
PoserPro2012NudeFigures
PoserPro2012PropsScenery
PoserPro2012QueueManager2012Installer
PoserPro2012ReferenceFigures

So, right click each of these and Unzip or Extract them all. I would recommend for the sake of not making it confusing, to keep them in the same folder your zipped versions are in.

NOW, ONCE YOU'VE UNZIPPED / EXTRACTED ALL FOLDERS, IF YOU GO INTO THE ""PoserPro2012Installer"" FOLDER, AND CLICK THE ""Install Poser Pro 2012"" RED EXECUTABLE FILE, IT'S GOING TO INSTALL THE PROGRAM AND LEAVE BEHIND ALL THESE LIBRARIES THAT COME WITH YOUR SOFTWARE, LEAVING YOUR INSTALLATION INCOMPLETE AND YOU UNABLE TO USE THEM.

It will give you a few options such as folder directories etc, and after making your selections, begin installing the program.

Everything seems kosher, and a green progress bar shows the program as installing everything to the end. However, after reaching the end and waiting for about 15 seconds to half a minute or so, error messages start popping up, and read like the following:

""The installer executable for a selected content package was not found in this installer's source directory
C:\Users\ [your computer's name ] \Desktop\Poser Pro 2012\PoserPro2012Installer\Content\PoserHair.exe

note that for each content package, it displays one of these error boxes, every time you click ""Ok"" and the ""PoserHair.exe"" is just one of 8 of these. But actually, the ""Animals"" content package is the first one that pops up of the error messages, since it's alphabetically trying to run each executable in order.

After one of these incomplete installations, you'll still be able to run and use Poser, only it's going to be missing a vast amount of content and libraries that make the program what it's supposed to be.

It took me several attempts of uninstalling, reinstalling to figure out what was going on, but once I really stopped and read the message, it became very clear.

Take another look at one of the 8 error messages I was receiving at the end of the installation. Note the error messages I displayed above, and pay attention to the directory it couldn't find the other executable files in.

""The installer executable for a selected content package was not found in this installer's source directory
C:\Users\ [your computer's name ] \Desktop\Poser Pro 2012\PoserPro2012Installer\Content\PoserHair.exe

On the last line above that appears on these error messages, you see ...\...\Content\...

""Content"" is what I want you to notice and pay attention to.

If you, like myself, have already had this problem at the end of your installation, then you might notice upon reading the error windows that pop up at the end of your incomplete installation, that it's looking for, and EXPECTING these other executable files (such as the ""...Hair or ...Animals"" files) -for these libraries and content to be in this ""Content"" folder.

However, it's not finding any of these files and installing the rest of the additional program content and libraries, because this ""Content"" folder doesn't exist, and thus these other executable files have not yet been placed in it. Hence the 8 ""error messages"" at the end of your installation that leaves out so much of the content and libraries that came with your program.

The problem going on upon this incomplete installation, is that it wants to run these files, and install the additional content that comes with each of them, but the installer is looking for them to be in ""Content"" folder, and EXPECTING them to be in the proper directory above. (by ""directory"", I mean the sequential order of folders within folders)

SO, WE MUST MANUALLY CREATE THIS NEW FOLDER IN THE PROPER LOCATION, AND LIKEWISE MANUALLY PLACE EACH EXECUTABLE FILE INTO THIS FOLDER, SO THAT UPON INSTALLATION, THE INSTALLER CAN FIND IT AND LIKEWISE INSTALL ALL THIS ADDITIONAL CONTENT AND LIBRARIES.

SO HERE'S WHAT YOU DO...

AFTER YOU'VE UNZIPPED ALL FOLDERS (AND HOPEFULLY LEFT THEM IN THE DEFAULT FOLDER THAT WAS AUTOMATICALLY CREATED ON YOUR DESKTOP UPON YOUR DOWNLOAD) YOU NEED TO MANUALLY CREATE THE ""CONTENT"" FOLDER IN THE EXACT SAME DIRECTORY THAT'S APPEARING IN THESE ERROR MESSAGES,

To do this, double click and go into the now unzipped / extracted version of the folder, ""PoserPro2012Installer""

You should see that little red icon / executable file that says ""Install Poser Pro 2012"". DO NOT OPEN / DOUBLE CLICK OR ACTIVATE THIS FILE YET.

Instead, right click anywhere within the empty space around the folder and on the pop-up menu that comes up, scroll your mouse down to ""New"" and then click on ""Folder"" on the new sub-menu that also pops up.

Now, rename that new folder you just created ""Content"" and make sure you spell it correctly.

So now that you've created this new ""Content"" folder, INSIDE THE ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder, YOU NOW NEED TO GO THROUGH EACH OF THE OTHER UNZIPPED / EXTRACTED VERSIONS OF THE FOLDERS LISTED ABOVE, AND BRING EACH EXECUTABLE FILE FOUND IN THOSE FOLDERS, AND PLACE THEM IN THE NEW ""Content"" folder you just created.

To do this, start with your first folder, ""PoserPro2012Animals"". Double click it, and once inside that folder, right click on the red ""PoserAnimals"" file. When you right click this file, select ""Cut"" about half way down the menu that pops up.

Back click out of that folder, (upper left arrows) until you see the folder holding the ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder, along with all your other zipped/unzipped folders.

Open up / double click the same ""...Installer"" folder, and once inside, open up / double click the ""Content"" folder.

Right click in the blank area of that folder, and select ""Paste""

REPEAT THIS PROCESS FOR EACH AND EVERY EXECUTABLE FILE IN THEIR RESPECTIVE FOLDERS.

There should be 8 folders each with their own red executable file you have to do this for, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO MOVE THE ""Install Poser Pro 2012"" executable to this ""Content"" folder. Just leave it in it's natural spot within the ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder.

Make sure you've properly done this for each of these other 8 folders and their respective executable files. (Go in, and right-click ""Cut"" them out of their natural folders, and ""Paste"" them inside the ""Content"" folder)

If you've done all these steps correctly, then here's what you should have:

Inside the ""Poser Pro 2012"" Folder that was automatically set up, and most likely on your desktop (other locations are fine as well) you should have:

--Some files (3 or 4 or so) that hold keys, ""read me"" instructions etc. (these have been here with your download so don't worry you didn't miss nothing)

--Your zipped versions of the 9 folders listed above.

--Your unzipped / extracted  version of the same 9 folders.

Within the unzipped ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder, you should have:

--A folder you created called ""Content""

--and below that a red executable file named ""Install Poser Pro 2012""

Within the ""Content"" folder, you should now have all the other (8) executable files you took from each of the other folders listed above.

They should be red icons and listed as follows:

Install Queue Manager 2012
PoserAnimals
PoserCartoons
PoserCasual
PoserClothing
PoserHair
PoserNudes
PoserProps

Note that the ""Install Poser Pro 2012"" executable file found resting naturally in it's own location one folder back, does not need to be moved here.

Now the installer will successfully find these other library and content packages it needs to give you all the bells and whistles of Poser Pro,

so activate / open / double click the ""Install Poser Pro 2012"" red icon resting inside the ""PoserPro2012Installer"" and if you've done everything correctly, you should be good to go, and a hopefully complete version of the installation that includes all the additional content and libraries should take place.

Hope this helps...

**********HERE'S THE SHORT VERSION**********

.. of how to make your installation a success without any of the problems I kept encountering

(1) After successful installation of all content from Amazon, Unzip / Extract / Expand all 9 folders (listed above)

(2) Go into the unzipped version of the ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder, and create a new folder inside it. MAKE SURE YOU NAME IT ""Content"" without any misspelling, spaces, etc.

(3) Go back into each of the other unzipped / extracted folder, and ""Cut"" the red executable file from each, placing all 8 into the new ""Content"" folder resting inside the ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder. (note, it's not ""9"" because the red executable inside ""...Installer"" folder, can and should be left alone)

(4) After doing this with each unzipped folder and the executable file inside, now go back to the ""PoserPro2012Installer"" folder, and click the ""Install Poser Pro 2012"" button.","IMPORTANT FOR YOUR INSTALLATION, PLEASE READ",True,1346025600,2.5649493574615367,1.0

"First, I don't understand the many different choices for basically the same Norton (antivirus) products. I already have Norton installed and purchased this in advance so I chose the 5 device key card. Also, you can try (15 or 30 day trial version) direct from Norton and, if you are happy, you can then get a key card to extend your subscription for an additional 366 days. I say choose the lowest cost to meet your needs.

Second, since I have been using Norton for years, I thought it would be easier just to renew my subscription with a key code. Plus, this one was for 5 devices so I could also include my 2 Android devices. Unfortunately, I encountered a problem with my key code on my second computer where it stated the key code was not for my product. I called Norton where a very courteous representative worked with me over the phone as well as online to complete my renewal subscription. Originally, she told me I would have to download a different version but, in the end, I was able to enter my key code to renew. I had no problem with my third computer.

My first (Lenovo tablet) Android device immediately upgraded (from lite Norton mobile version) to the full version once I signed into my Norton account. My second (Tianle TV stick) Android device did not upgrade where I needed to uninstall Norton for mobile app and re-install it. Once I re-installed the Norton for Mobile devices and signed into my Norton account, it immediately upgraded to full version.

Anyway, overall, I'm sure Norton AntiVirus is (and has been) a good product for internet online security. But, since there are many other good (and free) antivirus choices, I can only rate this product as okay. Also, I didn't like having a problem with my subscription renewal process.

FYI: I recommend including Norton's (free) Identity Safe program for computers and mobile app for Android/Apple devices. This is one of the better password manager interfaces.

"I learned to type in high school (on an electric typewriter, so I didn't get spoiled by spelling and grammar checkers), and I was already a pretty good typist on alpha keyboarding.  I am fair-to-middling on alphanumeric keyboarding and keypad data entry.  This software gives me a chance to practice and improve in all three areas.  The software does include levels for the brand-new and still-learning typist, although I can't speak to how well those work as I am already very experienced.  A few caveats:  While the alpha keyboarding and keypad data entry components are excellent, there is no component for true alphanumeric data entry (i.e. entering names, addresses, and phone numbers for database purposes).  The alphanumeric component is simply an integration of numbers and symbols into the alpha keyboarding paragraphs.  You need to be careful which scores you're looking at when deciding where you need to concentrate (or, say, you're putting together a resume and want to accentuate where your skills are); my alpha keyboarding is very fast and my alphanumeric keyboarding speed is mid-range, but my keypad data entry is pretty slow (I didn't cover that last in high school).  A combination score of all three of these is, I feel, unfair.  The games don't record the typing speed you achieve as you're playing, and you may not even see the typing speed if you are trying to concentrate on typing swiftly and accurately and can't look away long enough to see the current speed.  And, lastly, the ""Gone Fishing"" game sends the numbers darting too fast across the screen.

"Lately, my 4 year old daughter has been obsessed with computer games. I'm buying more games on CDs to decrease her exposure to the internet. She loves animals so I figured this would at least be mildly interesting. That turned out to be an understatement. She fell in love with it instantly.

There are four characters in the game and each has an animal friend. To play the game, you have to prepare each character and their animal for a pet parade by teaching the animal a trick, picking out clothes for the character, and designing a float for each pair. After each pair and their float is ready for the parade, you have to organize the parade and add special effects. Then, you start the parade and the program plays out the parade that you designed. The parade is actually pretty brief, but it can be played over and over as many times as you like.

The game can be quickly mastered by most children but has enough variety to encourage them to go back to repeat the tasks many times. There are a variety of clothing choices and float options. Even though it seems repetitious to me, my daughter doesn't seem to mind it - and she's very advanced with computer use. I've also noticed that when she goes back over and over to play the games where she teaches the animals their tricks for a specific parade, the game increases in difficulty so it's not monotonous. There are also several options for printables, including a cute friendship bracelet with your child's name on it.

This game certainly would not qualify as educational, although it does build good computer skills and hand/eye coordination. Overall, I would say it's just good, clean fun.

I gave this four stars because sometimes the program seems a little slow and there is a delay between screen changes. Also, you can't play the game without the CD in the disk drive, even after fully loading the game on the computer. This is a negative to me because for most kids, you would have to assist them with starting the game. However, my 4 year old has pretty much mastered inserting the CD, closing the drive drawer, and clicking on the program icon. I'm just not totally comfortable with her doing it when I'm not there. The last thing I need is to have a broken CD jammed in my computer...",Daughter LOVES this game!,True,1246147200,0.0,1.0
"I had the hard copy version of this installed for maybe 2 weeks, then, removed it. Originally, I did use the generous 90-day free evaluation time MS gives if you download it, and it did work okay, but for a few slight bugs, though I DID NOT elect to install the beta Defender, as I'd used that before and it was super unstable on my XP MCE, 2005 OS, and also showed many false positives. The $20.00 price on Amazon seemed like a very good deal, and my trial period was ending, so I picked it up. Upon reinstallation (My trial expired before the Amazon hard copy arrived, though not due to slow delivery, I cut it too close.), I had stability issues with it from day 1, and this time I did install Defender, which may be why, but I removed the entire program because of it. I'm just glad I didn't pay Bill G. the $50.00 list price! However, time changes things, and Defender is out of beta, I built a new rig, and so, I may give it another go, because I really like the idea of it, and the interfaces and settings and system info it provides. I'm a security freak anyway, with many other programs, however, I figured who know Windows better than MS, right? Besides, the anti-virus software it contains is one of the only ones that can run with many other AV programs, including my superb NOD32, so I liked the idea of having 2 actively running AV programs. Another drawback is the fact that it has automated defragging built into it, and you can't turn it off! If you don't want it to run, then, you MUST go into it's settings once a week and keep pushing up the day it runs, so that it doesn't. When I first got One Care, the auto defragstarted running, unbeknownst to me, while using the PC, and did that really destabilize my OS! Hmmmm, maybe 2 stars is too many just for the concept, and on second thought, maybe I won't reinstall it! Though, if you are new to PC's, don't have any other protection yet, this still might make a decent program for beginner's, plus it's liscensed to install on 3 PC's, good for home networks. Oh yeah, the one outstandingly good thing about it was the firewall would absolutely stop any new programs, both ways, until you decided to allow or disallow them, while most firewalls I've used react too slowly and any uploads or downloads have partially started before they reacted and sought your permission, which is WAY BAD NEWS. On that one feature, I give One Care 5 stars! You decide, but that's my biography on using it.

"I build a lot of computers.  I used to install Norton AntiVirus 2003 on all of them.  On a recent build, Norton Internet Security 2005 came on the motherboard disk so I thought I'd give it a try.  First I tried loading it before other programs and it thru the annoying repair-not-supported error making you uninstall then reinstall it.  So, I uninstalled it and waited until the rest of the software was installed.  When I tried again, it brought the computer to it's knees!  When I tried to uninstall it, it just locked up forcing me to rebuild everything from scratch loosing 2 days of work!!!  Enter McAfee...  The install ran perfect, the updates ran perfect, and the software performs perfect.  I can't comment on the spam program because I uninstalled it since my server already catches 99% of all spam.  Until Norton learns to play nice with Windows XP SP2, I'd strongly recommend that you use McAfee!!!  Oh and one other thing, any security program will use resources.  If your computer slows down that much, you need a new computer!  The computer I installed it on boots in 20 seconds!

"I have used Quicken for many years and I've always liked the product.  This version is a nice upgrade and is probably worth it for any Quicken owner to pick it up.
I also picked up Microsoft Money 2002 since it had a great rebate from the wholesale store.  Money will convert Quicken 2001 files cleanly, so it was easy to compare the products.  Microsoft Money is different, but equally capable for the most part.  I recommend Microsoft Money to anyone who has not already become familiar with Quicken.  Money seems to be easier to learn and use than Quicken.  But if you are comfortable with Quicken, I don't see any real value in Money over Quicken to justify the learning curve.
WARNING!!!  I recently had a minor problem with a corrupt quicken file which I corrected.  It made me more consciences about running VALIDATE periodically.  Before upgrading to Quicken 2002, I ran Validate and Super-Validate and no problems were found.  After upgrading I ran Validate and Super-Validate again, with no problems.  I went online to update my register and post payments and then I ran Validate once again.  This time I had 167 errors.  I don't know what it ""fixed"", but I got really nervous.  I validated a second time, no problems.  I went online again the next day, then validated again, and more errors were found.  I hope that Quicken is just cleaning up some online garbage ... no apparent problems exist in my data ... just please run VALIDATE frequently to be extra safe, and run your backups too.
I also had a problem where I had duplicate scheduled payments in my Quicken schedule.  I was able to identify which payments were legitimate and which were not, so I cleaned up that mess.  This problem is addressed in the Quicken knowledgebase, albeit poorly addressed.
This makes three seperate data problems with Quicken.  One with Quicken 2001 and two with Quicken 2002.  All within the last two months.  All three were caused by Quicken, so I am getting nervous about trusting this company with my data.  I am running Validate frequently now and I recommend that you do too.
I like Quicken and I will continue to use it as long as I can continue to trust it with my data.  I like the new features in this upgrade.  Microsoft Money is a great product as well, but not worth the learning curve to switch.

The scanner is an old Microtek X6EL scsi scanner.  The boot log shows that the scsi card, and the scanner are recognized.  Yet, when I try to use YAST to configure the scanner, no scanner is found.  When I try to configure a scsi scanner manually, no scsi devices are found.

"I will start this review by saying that I like all Chief Architect products. They are easy to use and deliver great results. However, I have a problem with the way they tier their Home Designer product line. At the top of the line you have the Pro version, which has all the tools available. That's also the only available trial download if you want to try before you buy. You also have several tiers under the Pro version with a decreasing feature set for every notch down that you take. But you can't try those. Looking at the detailed feature comparison matrix on their website, I found the Architectural version to be the best bang for my bucks, since per the matrix I was only giving up on advanced tools. I'm pretty sure you must be thinking the same or you wouldn't be reading this review.

I was wrong.

I purchased the Architectural version thinking that I would be able to model my simple standard Dutch Colonial Revival home. Well I can't. The Architectural version is missing crucial roofing tools, which prevented me from completing my roof. I asked for help on their support forum and I was told that in order to complete my roof I had to use the Pro version at 500 bucks. Now again this is a very common roofing style in the Northeast, nothing fancy or out of the ordinary. But it has dormers and in order to fully control those you need the Pro version.

Aside from the roof, many other less-crucial tools are missing, such as half the camera options (no orthogonal views, no texture showing in vector view) and many other irritating omissions I can live with. After all they need to justify the premium for the Pro option.

If their matrix had stated that half the roofing tools are missing I would have probably not purchased the Architectural version. I would have gone for the Pro version (ouch) or the product of a competitor (hint: Punch!).

So in conclusion, the Pro version is a good product, Architectural a lot less so. If your needs are so simple that you don't need the roofing tools in Pro, I suggest you instead look at free software such as Google SketchUp or even Autodesk Homestyler. As far as I'm concerned I will have to upgrade to Pro, a little bitterly I must say.",Disappointed by the lack of roofing tools,False,1302739200,3.7612001156935615,0.0

"Corel Draw is a venerable drawing program which I have been using for more than 15 years, back when it was a 16-bit Windows program.  It is impossible to give a description of its many features and capabilities, except to say that it has everything I need and a whole lot more.  It is capable of accurate and scaled technical drawing; it can also be very expressive.  And if vector drawing is not enough, it comes with an image manipulation program too.

I was dismayed when I installed release X6 and found it  REALLY pokey (waiting a second or two for most operations, including simply drawing a rectangle), and my quad-processor 16GB W64 system is reasonly high power.  I was further dismayed when trying to scroll-select off the bottom of the screen (which should cause autoscrolling to occur until you move the cursor back into the window) hung the program; I had to kill it from Windows Task Manager.  Despite all the wondrous features of the program, it was nearly unusable, and I was about to post a 2-star review.

But the other day when I started it up, it offered Update 2, which claimed to address performance and stability issues.  It does!  Performance is good, and so far, at least, no hangs or crashes.

I would give it five stars, except that it does not still include the large clip-art and font libraries that it had 10 years ago, and though I still have these, some at least are not compatible with the current version.  I'm taking a star off for that.

It also does not support 3-d drawing, the way a CAD program or (ex-Google) Sketchup does.  Sketchup, in particular, is free (for the entry-level version), and is great for drawing 3-d models of things I want to build.  Sketchup, like Corel, does an excellent job of mapping screen/print dimensions to real-world, a feature that is very important to me.

Otherwise, for a full-featured drawing program, it's pretty much Corel Draw or Adobe Illustrator, both of which I think are top notch, though I have not fully explored Illustrator.  I'm still happy with Corel and am glad that they are keeping it  current, including support for 64-bit Windows.","Great drawing program, but be sure to install Update 2!",False,1356307200,1.0986122886681098,1.0

"I have used H&R Block software for several years because I find the TurboTax alternative annoying and overpriced. As an experienced system builder and software writer I figured I would be relatively immune to the install problems others have reported here with Windows 7. Well I was wrong. HRB did install in my Win 7 - 64bit system, and I did manage to import last years business return and create W-2's for employees and a W-3 for this year - just. Then it stopped working. Would not start (even when running as admin), yet refuses to uninstall because it claims to be still running; will install in XP virtual machine but then cannot access files I have already created in the 'real' Win-7 machine. I can deal with these issues, but I shouldn't have to. Most of them are peculiar to my own machine it is true, but software for release into the real world must be written and QC'd to handle all sorts of individual system quirks. Maybe it's 'OK' if something like a game doesn't run on some systems, or needs special tweaking, but it's inexcusable for mission-critical software like TaxCut. And if the system interface has been poorly QC'd there are obvious questions about how well the tax rules and computations have been checked. The HRB software is far from ready for release to the general public. In my own case, having handled (barely) everything I absolutely needed to get done by Jan 31, and fortunately having saved hardcopies of everything, I will probably sit tight and see what happens with updates of HRB, but unless there's a BIG improvement in its stability in Win 7 in the next month or so I'd guess I'll be doing my final taxes in TurboTax, much as I hate the thought.

I've upgraded it to 5.
The reason for the original review was because, although the software is beautiful streamline and pretty much free of crashes, it was rendering all my movies without sound.
I finally got connected with Sony support and they resolved the issue:
So, for all of you who are experiencing the same thing, here's what you do:
Although, I find this setup a little illogical, unlike other programs, this one has the rendering settings to default WITHOUT sound. You have to go into an advanced setting to render with sound.
When rendering click the ADVANCED button and choose a format and template (IE Program Stream NTSC Widescreen) and then click the CUSTOMIZE TEMPLATE button. Then click the AUDIO tab. Check INCLUDE AUDIO STREAM.
CLICK OK.
What I did, was SAVE this setting as a template and now I don't have to worry about it anymore. The SAVE feature is at the top of the Customize Window. (see image I included with review.)
About the software:
I'm comparing it to Premiere and Pinnacle Studio.
My problem with Pinnacle is that they have AWFUL customer service. The software is bloated and crashes in the middle of every project. They have a 14 day window for customer service and , after that, charge you if you need to speak to them. (What???!) Pinnacle used to be a great software program and then they made it overly complex and overloaded with features.
Adobe Premiere is very professional and loaded with cool features, but it's got a very unfriendly user interface for the ""average Joe"" who wants to edit cool looking home movies.
SONY's program is very clean looking. The buttons are big and the user interface is not cluttered.
You want a transition, click one. ( in Pinnacle it's an Easter-egg hunt every time I need to add an effect... and then it crashes.)
The rendering is a bit slower than the other programs, but who cares? As long as it renders right.
I'm upgrading to the Movie Studio ""Suite"" version so I can get the other programs in the bundle and the FX packages.
Once I got connected with Customer service, I have to say, I was really impressed. The guy qualified the problem, he looked at a sample file and came back with the answer i needed.",Five stars all around.(and a tip on how to RENDER WITH SOUND!),True,1423180800,1.9459101490553128,1.0

"As someone who has had good experience with NIS 2004 and 2006 over the past 3 years, I hesitated to install NIS 2007 after reading all the negative reviews posted on Amazon. Numerous reviewers who appear to be experienced computer users indicate dramatically slowed internet access and computer crashes trying to go on-line, problems in starting up, problems with running standard software, and problems with NIS installation. One reviewer, trying to counter these concerns, suggests that perhaps the problems these folks were encountering are due to not having configured the installation properly; but this raises further concerns by implying that, in 2007 (unlike prior years), some sophistication is now required during the installation process.

So it was with some trepidation that I finally gave in and bought NIS 2007. My conclusion, after a week with this new software: It's just fine. It installed easily. It has not slowed my e-mail and internet access one iota, nor has it otherwise degraded computer performance. Users with 1GB RAM probably do not need to worry about encountering problems if they install NIS 2007.

My success with this software could be due in part to the fact that I have 1GB of dual-channel RAM. (The Sept 2007 issue of Consumer Reports indicates that you probably need 1 gig of memory for use of any of the security suites on the market.) Perhaps some of the reviewers who have had bad experiences had inadequate RAM. Also, I have a Windows XP system with only standard software packages on my computer (e.g., MS Office 2003, WordPerfect Office 12, Paint Shop Pro X); perhaps some of the folks who have had problems have more esoteric web-derived software. I have Time Warner broadband internet access; I wonder if the problems may be related to the specific internet access provider, or the nature of the access (dial-up vs. DSL vs. cable).

This is not to dismiss the serious problems that some have experienced. There is clearly a finite chance that a problem can be ecountered with any security suite. (A friend bought a Dell computer with McAfee pre-installed, and her Time Warner broadband service stopped operating until McAfee was uninstalled.) I'm just suggesting that your chances of having a problem with this product are probably much smaller than the number of negative reviews here would imply, since it's the folks who have had problems who are most likely to post reviews here.

I give NIS 2007 4 rather than 5 stars because Consumer Reports (Sept 2007) rates its effectiveness the lowest of the security suites it reviewed. However, in the 3 years I've been using NIS, I have not experienced any of the threats that NIS is supposed to guard against. So either I'm lucky, or the suite is doing its job. I also grade NIS 2007 down for saying on the box that only 256MB RAM is required, when, in fact, RAM requirements may be four times that.","Despite the negative reviews, NIS 2007 should be fine for most users with 1GB RAM",False,1187913600,1.0986122886681098,1.0

"In Taxcut website customer surport page, they claim the valid range for an ITIN is ***-70_*** to ***-80-***. However, the IRS website publishes the range as ***-70-*** to ***-88-***.

I called Taxcut twice, and pointed out this problem, but the support people were either too ignorant of the ITIN number and software update routines, or just gave me some wierd unhelpful solutions, such as delete the number, close the software, wait for 5 minutes, then try again. I am having little hope that Taxcut will fix this problem this year, and I can only do a paper-filing now even though I paid for the version with e-file included.

"Long known for their innovative and stable products Autodesk has again hit upon a great package aimed at the smaller or start-up firms out there with their Autodesk AutoCAD Revit LT Suite 2013. Please note that this package (single seat) and its functionality is not meant for large(r) firms nor firms already fully in the BIM world.

That said this package is excellent for the small office user or ones that are considering transitioning to BIM (Building Information Modeling).

The suite offers both the 3D BIM tools as well as drafting and more 'traditional' tools of AutoCAD LT software (LT being the 'lite' version of AutoCAD offerings). Having BOTH means that you can continue your production work in LT while transitioning to BIM in Revit LT. well thought out Autodesk!

Autodesk Revit LT assists you in creating extremely high quality/accurate designs, documents, etc. all within a coordinated 3D environment. Need to make a change or revision? No problem! All changes are automatically updated throughout the model meaning less work and less mistakes!

Key features of Autodesk Revit LT and/or AutoCAD LT 2013 Suite include:

DOCUMENTATION:
Create documentation with 2D drafting and detailing tools
Full annotations
Automate the creation of schedules based on building components
Automatically calculate and track material quantities in cost estimates
Automatically update all documentation view when revisions are made

3D MODELING:
Use specialized architectural modeling tools for BIM to concurrently design and document

VISUALIZATION AND PRESENTATION:
Easily generate 3D orthographic or perspective views from any angle
Produce compelling, photorealistic renderings with Autodesk 360 rendering
Create real-time animations/walkthroughs to visualize the building virtually

COLLABORATION:
Design, document, and share files in the DWG format
Reference other file formats, including DFW, etc.
Exchange Revit files with stakeholders using Autodesk Revit

Net sum: This is a great 2-in-1 package for close to or maybe even less than a single seat of AutoCAD. Wonderful for a small firm wishing to make a big impact. Not overly heavy on laptop computer while other items are open (e.g. Outlook, browser, iTunes).",Nice package for the small or start-up firm,False,1353888000,1.791759469228055,1.0

"This is a unique little device which has given me visibility into stuff that I really don't know how to look at otherwise. I spend much of my time hardening my infrastructure against failure, the whole enterprise mantra of no single point of failure etc etc. The problem is that networks have this really unique feature that they can be 'kinda' failed, which is to say that stuff kinda works and packets are kinda getting through and all the links are up and yet the network is *borked*.

The requirement of any good operations team is to be able to identify the problems and hunt them down and fix them quickly.

In steps this product, something to screw up your network, but in a programmatic way, now you can cause problems and see how those kinds of issues manifest in your overall infrastructure.

The huge benefit here is you can ask questions like ""What does it look like if one of my two aggregated link starts dropping packets?"", ""How does jitter issues manifest in the VOIP network?"", ""Packet loss on the LAN vs packet loss on the WAN?"", the list goes on and on.

Selective impairment of the network uncovers where your algorithms, measuring, and responses are weak.

"I used TurboTax in 2006 for the first time with no complaints. Then again, my return was pretty simple. I basically bought it because I am no good with numbers and felt safer having a double check for myself.

This year I purchased again and it was horrible! My return was more complex, having purchased a home and having multiple work deductions. All said and done, TurboTax told me I owed about $1100! After a moment of panic, I called a lifelong CPA who was a friend of a friend and took the same documents in to him. Looking over TurboTax's work he was amazed. He told me it was all wrong. Numbers were in some forms and not others, the wrong forms had been used, and some things I could have deducted weren't there at all because TurboTax's ""Deduction Maximizer"" didn't tell me I could.

All said and done, we saved over $500 by his redoing our taxes and got tips on getting more back next year. Plus he E-filed for free. TurboTax charges you $18 for that.

"If you do DVD's or make slide shows of your photos, you will find that the best and easiest program BY FAR is VideoShow Expressions by Individual Software. I have used WonderShare, Roxio, AShampoo, and a few others. VideoShow Expressions is the easiest to use and understand; it is the most versatile of all the programs on the market. They also have SlideShow Expressions which is good, but it is not as strong a program as VideoShow.

I have noodles for brains when it comes to doing things on the computer, but I have to say that this program is almost effortless to learn and use. One of the reasons that this program outshines the others is because of the simplicity of the pan & zoom feature. You can decide what angle the picture comes in and zoom in and out, rotate, go back out, and how long it sits there if at all. When you add your music you can decide how many seconds each picture will be and loop the music or you can have the photos timed to the length of your music.

You do not have to use the irritating film graphs that the other programs have, they have simplified this program so a six-year-old can figure it out. My recommendation for picture times is 11 to 12 seconds per picture and adjusting your music and or pictures so it comes out in the end to that. Sounds confusing, but it is much easier to do than it sounds. Any less than 10 seconds a photo, the pictures move too fast and any longer than 14 seconds a photo becomes boring.

I may do things a bit differently than most, but all my photos are kept in dated files on my computer (which are backed up on disks and external drives). They are all sized to 3"" at the largest edge and 150 or 200 ppi, this way you can enlarge or reduce them at any time with no damage to the photo and without using too much space on your hard drive. I use Micrografx Picture Publisher for all photos - again easiest program to work (although I do use PhotoShop when I want to ""fake"" pictures). When I want to make a video I make a new file copy and paste all the pictures I want to use in it, and then I arrange them in the order I want them. Once they are in order I rename each of them to a number in the order of use, My original pictures are still in their original files with their original names.

When I open my VideoShow Expressions and get to the part that says ""add photos"" I can go to that file and select the photos which just load in the order I want them. Should I decide I want to move them around... dragand drop is king! Then you can take the photos that you want to add text to - write, size & pick color, and then drag the text to the correct spot on the photo. Next take each photo and decide what pan & zoom you will use - they can all be different - and the percent that the photo stops at the beginning or the end of the transition. I generally just do a 20% stand still after the transition. The exciting part of this is that the program also has video transitions, so picking random transitions along with the pan and zoom makes your video come alive. Most programs have the transitions, but not the pan and zoom feature.

Once you are satisfied with how each photo looks, click next and pick your songs (which are already suppose to be on your computer). Say you have 220 photos and they are going to each go about 12 seconds. You are looking at songs that will add up to about 2,640 seconds (or about 44 minutes worth of music). Check the box that says fit photos to the music length. Do a preview and after you catch your breath at the thrill of it all, you can SAVE & CLOSE. Then when you open it up again you can pick your theme and title, save, and then you can write to disk. You need a DVD writer and you want to choose (TV and/or the NTSC setting), best fit and usually the 4 mbits per second and variable rate. My computer is very particular and for awhile would not accept certain selections, but after trial and error, those are the settings that seem to work best.

When it has finished writing it will ask if you want to do another - don't because it is a long process (up to six hours if your computer is slow). You are better off to save your first disk (mark it as original) and then use your copy disk feature to make as many copies as you want. This program also has a feature to make CD or DVD labels; you can make fancy labels from the templates and add your own writing and pictures.

If this isn't enough, the program also allows you to make DVDs from your video camera and even combine photos and videos with seamless transitions on the same DVD. I have not done this yet, but this program is a must to have if you want to make DVDs of your pictures or videos.",Best program ever,False,1257984000,2.19722457733622,1.0

"The poor rating is due to sending of a product previously known to be defective.  Norton deserves a five-star as I have been repeatedly using their products since 1996.

This was just a product key but the product key was defective.  My first attempt to have this corrected returned the Indian sub-continent response to follow the instructions on the back of the card with the product key which obviously did not work or I otherwise would not have had to contact them concerning the defective product key.  I had even explained the additional steps and troubleshooting to confirm that the issue was with an invalid product key but apparently she lacked either the English skills or technical knowledge to understand the issue.

The next day I used the option to have someone call me.  This person admitted that they had problems with a series of product keys and would send one to me without having to go the return route.  He stated that he had tried same-day delivery but that it was too late in the day so it was sent next-day delivery.  It was sent next-day but USPS meaning that if and when they get around to it the product will appear in the mailbox, which it did late in the afternoon.

Bottom line is that I was unable to use the product for nearly two days while waiting for a valid product key to arrive and my request to have a product key emailed instead was not answered.

"Corel Fusion ... I bought it as an early release last year, and today, Corel still sells only version 1.0.0.  No updates are available.  Will they ever?  Does it need updates?  My answer is most certainly, but until then, it has its useful side.

What I use it for:
...1.  Expanding or combining documents -- not just pdfs, but office suite products such as from Microsoft or a version of Open Office - it claims over 100 supported filetypes.  It probably does, but maybe it will not support all the features of each orginally created product.  Examples under Cautions, below.  Don't assume they are comprehensive.
...2.  Rearranging PDFs -- for instance -- I put together several documents to be sent as a single fax while retaining a digital copy.  When I have several audiences, its easy in assembly mode to rearrange pages for different emphasis, delete unneeded pages, add new ones in a single package, regardless of original and mixed formats that may be present.

What I wish I could do:
...1. Add password / encryption.
...2. Edit documents directly: (its possible to make simple substitutions, such as correct spelling from ""to"" to ""two"" for example, but) its not possible to replace sentences across multiple lines in one simple step.

Cautions:
  If you have a PDF form which allows you to save data in fields, and you have done so with another product, DON'T use that file with Fusion.  When I save such a file with this product, the field data is omitted and deleted (even from view in real-time)!

  If you embed graphics in a Word type document, keep a backup.  This product may mis-render some of the colors.

  The document has not printed all my PDFs clearly.  For instance, I had a form with 3% of the text oriented vertically along an edge; and I've had otherwise normal text with phrases bolded.  In both cases part of the text on those lines printed too faint to read.  They printed fine, in the main competitor's product.

Quirky Registration: Watch your order fulfillment documentation carefully -- look for a serial number in the format of XXXX-XXXX- etc.  Entering it into the program will take you out of trial mode.  The quirky part is if you try to register via the website, it will hand you a confirmation code not at all like the SN and doesn't work for the program's activation prompt.

Shame on the manufacturer for making zero fixes since April 2011.  Other reasons for downgrading it are (1) sometimes possible to lose content or (2) have graphics altered.  For simple text documents it works fine, but if you  create tables, insert graphics, use outlines, change fonts or styles, test out the trial version thoroughtly before making a decision.","Great Interface, Easy to use for ""vanilla"" documents",False,1333065600,0.0,0.0

"I have been a long-time user of FamilyTree Maker software and a big fan since they first started.  I am also a long-time subscriber to Ancestry.com.  With FamilyTree Maker 2011, their new software has become increasingly complicated and difficult to understand.  There is WAY too much 'going on.'  What was once simple and straight-forward to enter, see, and retrieve as far as information, notes and photos on individual family members is now all over the place.  I can no longer recommend FamilyTree Maker software.  It is not 'fun', and certainly not easy-to-use.  If you're a beginning genealogist, try getting hold of one of their older versions - like FamilyTreeMaker 16 - where each family member appears on a clear single page of their own - where you can enter a spouse and children - and their parents names appear above them, and you can easily access notes, facts and photos without four dozen other things going on.  The current version is overkill and I think that in spite of all the hype and tying the product into their TV show, many people will be turned off to this unnecessarily overly complicated, difficult-to-understand newer version.  This really was a case of ""if ain't broke don't fix it.""  The makers took what was an excellent concept and product and overworked it to death and I think scared off their loyal consumer base - myself included.

Doing a restart did not help the problem.  I stopped trying to move from component to component and just tried to work in the Editor but the program shutdown while working there too.  It looks like it has a lot of nice features and for the money it would probably be a very nice program if it ran without problems.  Applying some of the effects takes quite a bit of time even with 8 GB of memory!  One option I did like is that you can use ""large icons"" in the user interface which helps when the monitor is set to a high resolution.

"The lastest version of Norton's 360 product is really starting to come together nicely.  In previous versions, it still seemed like several diffferent products simply stuck together to make a single product.  In this version, all of the different components seem to be integrated into one single easy to use package and central interface.  You still have to deal with different interfaces once you begin to drill down into each individual component.  Overall I am pleased with the performance, the capabilities of each component, the centralized management and the protection this product provides.  My only complaint is that some of the components still feel a bit clumzy and require some manual configuration or manipulation to work correctly.  For example, when setting up the trust map and network map of your home network, the interface seems very clumzy and it does not automatically detect the device type or even the device name for you.  All of this has to be entered in manually, which can become a real nightmare if you have several items within your network.  What makes this task even harder, is that this whole function did not feel well thought out or easy to use like the other areas of the product.  It wasn't clear as to which settings to use for each device or what each setting really meant.  I still find that part of the product unclear and not well thought out.  There are other small areas that I felt needed improvement as well, but that piece seemed to be the one that really seemed lacking compared to the rest of the product.  All-in-all though, this product would be a great asset for any user to own to secure their systems from modern security threats from all areas, as well as to ease the never ending task of managing user names and passwords for everything we touch theses days.

"I have been a Money user for a decade or more.  I use it for both business and personal finances.  I liked being able to track all of my business expenses in one place and knowing how much profit/loss I've made since day 1.  I was really worried when I read that Money was going off the market, and disappointed to find that there really aren't any comparable products on the market.  I decided to give Quicken a try, although I was scared by the negative reviews.

I had no trouble at all importing the files from Money.  Everything transferred over, although I did have to spend a little time changing the name of some of the online banking services so that they matched Quicken's.  It also took me a little time to figure out how to set up the business side of things.  But now that everything is set up, it's running smoothly.  There are still some things that aren't great (when I have a transfer between accounts, it doesn't automatically figure things out; I have to go in and adjust things on one side to put it in the right category then go delete the duplicate transaction in the other account), but it wasn't nearly as bad as I feared.

Yes, Money is a little bit slicker in appearance.  But Quicken doesn't really look like something from 1994.  Everything is in one spot, and it's easy to see where the money is coming from and going to.  I like that the business side has the tax categories for schedule C all set up.

I just upgraded from Painter 11 to Painter 12.  You can do some pretty amazing stuff with Painter.  You will also get some pretty amazing headaches.

Painter is the buggiest software that i have ever used.  And it has the worst product support i've ever encountered.  Support is noneexistant.  Even when you pay 20 bucks to call and ask a question, the chance of having a problem solved is minimal.  If you point out a legitimate bug with Painter, Corel will confirm the bug--but then tell you that ""the problem you encountered is not a product defect, however, [it is] a change in the new version"".

that's an actual quote from Corel product support when i pointed out that Painter 12 was saving corrupted jpeg files.  sheesh.  Really, Corel changed Painter 12 to save corrupted jpeg files--on purpose?!

I'll say this, the phone people are polite and try to help, but they have their hands tied behind their backs because Corel isn't interested in solving any problems.

Once you buy into painter, they have you by the short and curlies.  They know you can't go anywhere else and therefore corel doesn't have any motivation to make their product better.  Check out Painter forums before you buy.  You will see that people are complaining of the same bugs from version, to version, to version.  they never get fixed.

the sad thing is, you'll probably have to use Painter anyway.  Like i said, there's no real viable alternative.  But at least you'll know in advance the hair-pulling that you are in for.  sigh.

As for the mobile app. It's OK. What I really hate is that you can not see scheduled events in the mobile app. So, if you typically charge $50 a week in gas on CC 1, you can not pull that up on the app and apply it. HUGE shortfall on Inuits side. Lastly, sync is PAINFULLY slow.

I have been using Turbotax for 15 years (and MacinTax before that) and it seems to get more refined and yet more user friendly and easier every year.,Good software,True,1395446400,0.0,1.0

"After reading several reviews I decided to switch to H&R from Turbo tax because of them removing Schedule C and cost.  The install and set up went smooth.  It imported my Turbo tax info great.  I am clergy so we have several different sometimes confusing tax situations, but H&R seemed to include them...until I went to state taxes.  After completing everything I noticed I have a nice credit because of property tax, a credit I didn't receive last year because my total income was too high.  The reason is because H&R forgot to include housing allowance back into calculating the credit (specifically mentioned in Michigan 1040CR instructions)...oops.  Then went to ask a tax question to clarify if I am right (and more likely to notify them of the error to correct) and was directed to the technical support chat room every time.

"I'm writing this review using  MacSpeech Dictate program. I will not correct any errors that may come along during the transcription. What do I think about this program? It has learned my voice and generally works well in spelling correctly things I dictate. My problem with the program is what it does not do, particularly in comparison with the Dragon speech program. In Dragon speech I am able to dictate in programs such as WordPerfect and Word and without touching the keyboard I can save the file and print the document. I have not been able to do this with the MacSpeech Dictate program. If the program is capable of doing this, then the documentation is woefully inadequate for showing the user how to do some of these things. If the program is not capable of doing this, the question is why not?

For me the value of  software lies in how well it does little things as well as the big things.  wife certainly enjoy-that did not come out right.

"For the price, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 (Family Edition) is bargain priced.  First, customers can run the program on three computers. Second, the program can be used for two years without additional costs, while it has all the features of the more costly Norton Internet Security.  It does lack some desirable features of Norton 360, Version 2.0.  But Norton 360 is more costly and subscription must be renewed every year.  If you want more features like Tune-up, Back-up, or Online Back-up, Bitdefender offers another similar program called Total Security 2009.  It has all the features of Norton 360, Version 2, and it also sells with a two year subscription.

I have installed and used Internet Security 2009 on Windows XP for almost two months without any problem. In fact, my computers seem to run a little faster than they did when using Norton 360 - for all Norton's claims of tuning up the P.C. and optimizing its performance. Additionally, Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 runs without annoyingly drawing as much attention to itself as does Norton 360.

I'm permitted to update this review, and I will if I experience any problems.  Until then, I can only say that Bitdefender's Internet Security 2009 is a good program and a really good buy.

12/19/09 UPDATE: After using this program for about three months I took it off to install Kaspersky Internet Security 2010.  After the install and update, I ran a full scan and found a missed virus on one computer, a network threat and a privacy threat on a second computer.  This is not good, but it could be worse.  Neither the virus or the other missed threats caused me any harm.

"Well, I have been a loyal TurboTax buyer for years and years and years.  I thought my tax situation was so simple, I wouldn't run into the Deluxe vs. Premier situation.  No rental property, no exotic investments, nothing at all complex.  Income from my job, normal retirement/health savings account/savings funds, housing & charity deductions and a small money-market type investment with Edward Jones.  I read through and tried to understand to make sure I was okay with Deluxe.  Ha!  That 'small' investment means I should have bought Premier.  I called the hotline, they upgraded me for $10.  I hope Intuit enjoys that $10, that's the last money I'm sending their way.  I'm so irritated.  The (very nice) person on the hotline mentioned TurboTax knows they did a poor job of marketing it.

"I actually bought MacSpeech Scribe, and for my purposes, it's useless.  It's so much faster to just transcribe by hand.  I did train quite a bit and used clear audio files with no background noise  If the Scribe transcriptions  were 60% right AND there was a decent editor that allowed you to get the job done faster, it would not have been a complete waste.  It's the lame editing capabilities that makes it a total waste.  For example, Scribe gives me about 15 options of one segment of audio.  It's faster to type than go through all Scribe's choices looking for the best.  OK, so I don't look through the long list.  I choose the first and edit so it's correct.  That could be useful, BUT when the user edits this segment Scribe erases the audio corresponding to that that segment of text so the user can't play the audio again to double check.  This was a total waste.  There's a reason there's no trial version.  No one would buy it if there were. Oh yeah,you'd think they'd allow standard flash video input (.flv) but it doesn't.

The installation file is located in the ""Poser9-Poser9-Installer"" folder. Not too tricky, but maybe a bit much for novices. It certainly would have been nicer had they just included a .exe file, but I'm sure there's a good reason why they didn't.

I don't know if that other person's comment that they never plan on updating to VISTA is true, but if it is, I will be heart-broken.

"Installed this version of Quicken Premier 2014 over my 2011 version.  Was a bit nervous about file corruption and other issues listed by previous people, but none of those issues happened to me. I allowed the program to fully install and update before I did any importing, which may have helped, but regardless, once I got my old file imported, everything worked just fine. All the data was there, my accounts were still listed for one-step update and while I did have to ""reselect"" all my accounts for updating (were unchecked for one-step for some reason) - the rest worked great.

I really haven't delved into the features of this version too much, so can't speak to any of the slowdown that some folks are experiencing, nor have I tried the mobile capability (although I doubt I will, as I don't want my data out on the cloud).  I did note that my ability to accept new transactions takes a little longer (processing perhaps), but not so bad as to cause me to throw up my hands in frustration.  Some of the layout and features I did see upon login seem nice and I am looking forward to testing them further.

Prior to upgrading, I made an additional backup of my files to ensure any ""corruption"" could be reversed.  None occurred, but I highly recommend you make a backup just in case - better safe than sorry.

I don't get paper statements any longer (not to save trees, but because I hated the clutter...and well, trees are cool too), so my only proof of financial ownership is online at the bank, where they store stuff for a few years and then purge it (unless I made offline backup copies of each of those each month).

"I decided to make the plunge a week ago and installed Ubuntu 8.04 on a second hard drive to see how it would work. The next computer I buy will use Ubuntu (or some other version of Linux). Except for those with specialized needs, there is no longer any reason to support an expensive legacy system like Windows.

I installed Ubuntu on a four-year old eMachines PC. It was a hassle-free process, taking about 10 minutes (mostly of waiting while the computer did its thing). I was most concerned that there would be some hassle getting drivers for my wireless network adapter, but as it turned out, there was no need to worry. The adapter was recognized immediately, and I was surfing the Internet within three minutes of installing the OS.

Ubuntu comes with the software needed for everyday needs, such as a browser, a word processor and an e-mail program, plus quite a few extras, such as chat software and some simple games. The only difficulty I've had was installing some specialized software that isn't officially supported by Ubuntu, but the Ubuntu web site includes plenty of articles and forum discussions that helped me resolve the issues I had. Otherwise, installing software that's supported by Ubuntu is easier than installing software for Windows.

The interface is fairly intuitive. It's not quite the same as what Windows users are used to, but it has a much cleaner look and isn't difficult to figure out. And it's easy to customize the desktop; Microsoft seems to take the attitude that the user should adapt to do things Microsoft's way, but Linux takes the opposite approach.

The only issue I'm dealing with now is that the sleep mode creates some video instability in my computer, but I don't know if this is an Ubuntu problem or a hardware problem.

Overall, I'd highly recommend Ubuntu. A few years ago, Linux was for geeks only. But with Ubuntu and some of the other Linux packages out there, that's no longer the case. The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because there are still some web sites, such as some of those providing high-definition streaming video, that make it difficult (or officially impossible) to use anything other than Internet Explorer. Such sites are few, but they could be a dealbreaker for some users.","Great software, and the price is right",False,1221609600,1.6094379124341005,1.0

"I had an old FTM version 4.1 on my old PC.  It was pretty easy to use, but I switched to Macs a couple of years ago and had to put the genealogy aside.  When I decided to finally get a Mac genealogy program, FTM was the obvious choice.  In retrospect, I should've gone with something else.

First, as others have noted, FTMM only imports the newer FTM formats plus GED.  I thought it would import my old FTM files - NOT!  So I exported the old file to GED format and imported them into FTM.  It looks like it imported everything, but I can't be sure.

Second, the user interface is not intuitive, at least for me.  The old version was very clear about family structures: parents were up on top, children down below.  FTMM is divided into windows and several times I've entered a list of children, only to find out later that I entered them under the wrong parent!  Moving from one individual to another is clunky, primarily because I have to pay close attention to make sure I'm moving to the right person.  Sometimes it won't let me move like I want to and I have to go to the index to select the individual.

I've had some issues with FTM locking up my Mac if I close the window without quitting the program.  Solution: quit the program EVERY TIME.  I just got a new FTMM update a day or so ago - maybe it'll solve the problem, maybe not.

About the only really good thing is that FTMM came with a 6-month subscription to Ancestry.  I'm using it while I can, but with Ancestry's outrageous prices, I won't continue when the subscription ends.  (Note to self: cancel Ancestry in June!).

"Havent got the slightest idea why iTunes does such a pathetic job of simply organising its own library but TuneUP is an absolute must for anyone who uses an iPod or phone.

Was first recommended it by one of the Geniuses in the Apple store when I mentioned that my library was a real mess. He knew exactly what was wrong and said that this program would completely fix it, which it did a bit.

Doesn't always match up your actual album art with what is on their database if there was more than one album cover but that doesn't really matter if it gives you correct album art and you didn't have it before so CHECK CAREFULLY before saving it's results.  Found over 300 CD art work and only had a problem with about 7.  Doesn't really know what to do with those 7 or with about 15 other ones with which it wasn't completely sure. But the app is great and an absolute must for anyone who rips their CDs onto their iTunes device.

It does have a problem in that when it is finding 4 covers for each separate CD in an (eg) opera, it separates each CD so you cant thereafter listen to them together. No, it doesn't know to join up multi-CD works which iTunes has separated. And (apparently) when it has put a wrong photo in as cover art, you cant then change it!!

Thus unfortunately what it can't handle is classical music, being completely baffled by the concept that Mozart, WA Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, an Evening with Mozart (which it lists under E) and Best of Mozart (which it lists under B of course) are all the same bloke, needing categorising together.  So it sprays classical music all over the library!

"I upgraded from Studio 7.  Having used a few different video editing software programs, Pinnacle is my favorite for editing video.  It has a relatively clean and intuitive interface.  It offers quite a few options that give you all of the flexibility to create a relatively decent video.  You will need to use other programs to help with the audio if you are going to get fancy, but that really goes for most of the other products in its price range too.
The problem has always been wrapping it up.  It always takes some kind of extraordinary process to bring the project to completion.  Your work should be done once you cut each scene to the size you want, add transitions between scenes and complete the titles.
Sometimes Pinnacle will be able to complete the project from start to finish. This is in my experience the happy exception.  Something always goes wrong, and it is never a smooth as it should be.
As an example,  my latest project is 40 minute video, I spent one weekend editing and titling the project, and the next two weekends trying to make a useful file from it.  After rendering the project for an hour or so I get a message that the program was unable to render the video.  When I finally got it to finish the MPEG-2 file, I couldn't get it to burn to the DVD.
I finally bought Ulead VideoStudio 7.  This program worked to complete the project.  I had to take the MPEG-2 file from Pinnacle and re-render it using the menus from Ulead and created a mostly successful DVD.
Previously I have used Dazzle DVD Complete to finish the project when Pinnacle wasn't up to it, but couldn't use it this time for reasons too long to go into here.  Of course Pinnacle recently bought Dazzle.  Maybe there is some hope for Pinnacle Studio 9

"I began using Dragon for Mac a few years ago in my medical practice. In recent years, I began using Dragon to type at home even though I'm a fairly good typist, because I found the Dragon made fewer mistakes.  in fact,  Dragon was so good and so fast that I used it to write a  450 page book ""common sense is not all that common him""  which was published by Amazon's create space this past July.

"My review echoes the conclusions of numerous reviewers in 3 regards:

1) Installation takes a long time and renders your computer unusable while it is in process. My laptop was grinding away so loudly and got so hot that I had a huge regret that I hadn't backed up my files before starting the installation. I really thought that I was going to have a hard drive meltdown. My laptop is just 1 year old and does meet the minimum recommended requirements for this s/w. Startup of the software also takes a long time - probably about a minute. When you run it for the first time it finds and imports all applicable images, movies and audio files which also takes a very long time.

2) There is absolutely no help file or quick start guide. If you want help you have to pay for it. I've been a user of Microsoft and Adobe and other complex software products for decades and rely constantly on various on-line learning resources to become competent with those products. This condition will leave many potential users cold. The best way to ensure customer loyalty is to make sure that they can easily adopt and learn to love the products, and Corel has missed the mark here. The fact that support is a paid service is not evident in the marketing materials.

3) The user interface, while it seems to be similar to other video editing products, is not at all intuitive so a quick-start guide or high level overview would go a long way to getting the user to complete a first project. I tried several times to figure out the basics and abandoned each project in frustration. I have found some Youtube videos which should help, particularly this one:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlcFqL0uT3M

The software does seem to have the features and functions necessary to produce a comprehensive video, and I will be spending more time with it to try to crack the code; however I will not be paying for the user support that should be offered for free.

I had looked forward to the arrival of the Pinnacle Studio 18 software so that I could finally put together videos of still and video images from some of my recent trips and post them to YouTube.

"I have used this product in the past and find it has everything that I personally need to produce marketing materials.  Someone who is more knowledgable may or may not agree, but I've always gotten compliments from those that I am marketing to.  I have since changed jobs and have purchased this item to use at the new company.

My feeling at this point is that Nova Development is seriousely customer service challenged.  I needed this product to produce some materials for an upcoming presentation and had ordered it with plenty of time to spare.
I was installing it and had a glitch when at the prompt I inserted disc 2.  Upon calling tech support and working through the installation they had informed me that the disc was corrupted and they'd send a replacement.  The disc arrived about 10 days later (still in plenty of time for my presentation).  Well, this disc gave the same results upon inserting it.  I worked through the process again with tech support and they informed me that this disc is also corrupt and they'd send me a new one.  I asked that they please test the disc first and they said they would.  They did, however, refuse to overnight it as they did not have that decision making capability.  I asked to be kicked upstairs to have the conversation with a decision maker.  You'd think I'd asked them if they thought the moon were really made of cheese.  I could sense the dumbfoundedness through the phoneline.

Now, 2 weeks later I still do not have this disc.  I contacted customer service and tech support and they have no record of our conversation concerning the second disc or if it was ever shipped out.  I offered to forward them the confimation E-mails that came from them but they did not want me to (???????).

I have since contacted [...] (the original seller).  They informed me to deal only with their tech support as the manufacturers tech support features mostly slackjaws reading from manuals.  To this I can certainly attest.  I am presently awaiting contact from the sellers tech support team.

Those are all still present; in fact, the UI has managed to take a step backwards, never remembering window positions and sizes, and the redraw is even worse than before.  Now, however, there is a bug where any AVI file imported will rotate the image 90 degrees, while leaving the image frame not rotated, so everything looks like it was taken on a vertical camera phone, but is also rotated the wrong direction.  Contacting support resulted in a series of form-letter responses with occasional bits of unhelpful advice.  And to actually talk to a live human is 30 dollars for 2 months of phone support.

"Most movie making software at this point is very similar.  It's very hard to distinguish one from the other.  If you've ever used Movie Maker, iMovie or Final Cut, then you get the idea.  Sequential ordering of movies, photos and images with fancy transitions.  You lay an audio track and compile a video file.  The whole process is pretty simple.  Apple's Final Cut is safe to say the gold standard for consumer level movie editing. But for those of us in the Windows ecosystem, Windows Movie Maker is probably the most oft used application.  Makes sense seeing that it's free.  By default, it's installed with Windows 7.  If you run Windows 8, you have to download it from Microsoft.

But like the girl in the AT&T commercial, I want more.  I primarily use VideoStudio to edit my Contour videos.  If you aren't familiar with Contour, it's a wide angle camera much like the GoPro that is used primarily to film action sports.  I use it to film myself skiing and mountain biking.  The Pro X6 software really lends itself well to editing high action footage.  Point and area tracking is so easy that I didn't even have to break open a manual.

"I was looking for a GPS system for my convertible Miata.

The Microsoft Streets and Trips 2005 with GPS Locator is probably the best GPS system for 75$.

Any other GPS products (Garwin, Copilot, Palm, just to name a few) have very tiny screen,  don't have a keyboard (except the palm) and are much more expensive.

The Microsoft Streets and Trips 2005 with GPS Locator require a laptop which mean you can type in and modify your route anytime you want on the go... no need to do it at home or upload anything.

I use The Microsoft Streets and Trips 2005 with GPS Locator on a very old laptop ( a thinkpad Iseries 1400 bought in 2001, with windows 98, 64 MB ram and USB 1.1) and it works. Ofcourse the better is your notebook the better. But if you worry about system requirement, S&T 2005 will work with a 2001+ notebook..

The notebook is plugged into a 450 watts car power inverter which convert the electricity coming from the car lighter.

Becareful to choose the right Power Inverter.  See your notebook AC/DC powerbar.  If your Power Inverter is too low, your notebook may shutdown by it self.

Dont relay on your notebook internal battery either, you will drain your notebook battery too rapidely. You must use a power inverter.

You can buy these anywhere like Radioshack or any big car accessory retailers for around 50 bucks.

Installing the software.

Installation was easy, but make sure you do the Full install not the minimum. The minium install require that you leave one CD in the CD-Rom drive which is bad if your CD-Rom has auto shutdown energy saving feature...

Do the full install, require about 1 GB HD space.

Starting the software

It is true, when you start the software for the first time, sometime the GPS takes like 10 minutes to initialize (locate your position) and other time it takes only 10 seconds to locate.

Once your location shows on the map, your car should appear, and it refresh in real-time. (like a car racing video game) you will be able to see your car moving on the map in real-time as you move.

The downsides.

The downsides are:

1- No voice signal, Streets and Trips 2005 don't tell you when to turn. But then again, with Voice, it may require a more powerful notebook.

2- It runs on a Notebook, and notebook are kinda heavy and big to carry arround.

3- Its dangerous !!!!!!

  Do not look at your computer screen when you drive !!!! im not kinding !, Streets and Trips 2005 will not warn you if you're about to smash into another car !!!.

You should get a real copilot so he/she can hold the notebook and read the map for you. But DO NOT LOOK AT YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN WHEN YOU DRIVE. IT IS EXTREMLY DANGEROUS, for you, for your car, for your passengers and for everyone on the road.

I repeat, do not look at your computer screen when you drive.

"UPDATE 5/1/2014: In April 2014, after upgrading to 8.1 my laptop's WiFi adapter mysteriously began failing.

(This is exactly what Electronic Arts is currently doing with SimCity, the biggest video game failure in computer history). To ignore the needs of customers is the single biggest mistake a technology company can make. If I could downgrade my Win8's review score to a negative value I would.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: When Windows 7 came out my faith in Microsoft increased. This time around Microsoft has let me down considerably. This one star review is about what a mistake Microsoft is making with this release of Windows. Starting with 5 stars Windows 8 is fast under the hood and is optimized for modern tablet-like devices. Compatibility issues are few but do exist. Windows 8 boots faster and has some performance improvements so I'm sure many power users will go for it. The kinks, which I am about to explain, will be relieved over time by either Microsoft themselves or 3rd party help. So what happened? Why is it that Windows 8 will probably be OK for IT geniuses, and a confusing mess for everyone else?

To me this isn't even an OS upgrade, and it shouldn't be. Microsoft has replaced their beloved Start menu with a full screen box-style UI optimized for tablets. I'd consider this a good idea for an app that can live on top of Windows 7. This is by no means a reason to release a new version of Windows. 3rd party Start menus exist for Windows 8 so you can unbreak this mistake. What does this do for the millions of people who have learned how to use the Microsoft Windows operating system? Why, it simply alienates them and makes them unable to use their computer. Maybe a good time to switch to Mac! What does this do for Enterprise? Nothing! Nothing but annoy IT efforts and cause costly re-training issues. I'm not sure a bigger blunder is even possible.

And the new UI itself? Ugly. Functionality issues? Plenty. In Windows 7 you can just press the Start button on the keyboard and type a question; Windows figures it out. Not in Windows 8. You must choose a different ""Search"" mode, making Windows 8 clearly dumber and more cumbersome than the OS before it. Want to launch the App pinned to the leftmost spot on the taskbar? Whoops--that invisible Windows 8 Start box and sends you to the Metro Start Menu Of Doom--an ugly marketing driven zone where Microsoft hopes you buy into their bowl of punch and Microsoft-centric apps. This OS would sooner fool you into using a Microsoft app you've never heard of then guide you through the process of setting up your existing services on new tiles. I'm not drinking the punch.

And try turning off your computer? Umm.. Hello? Bill? Who approved this OS be released? Knock knock. Who's there? Bill. Bill who? Bill ya $15 and you won't be able to turn your computer off. (The button is there...somewhere)

I only wasted the $15 to learn more about this mistake and be on the cutting edge of... being an idiot and spending $15 I don't need to spend? I guess. Apparently it's faster, so all hope is not lost. So there ya go, one star for speed! Finally, who is in charge over there at Microsoft? I'm fairly certain 8th graders could design a cooler OS.

Update 11/10/12: The title of this update is ""No apps match your search."" I am still quite annoyed by having installed Windows 8 on my laptop. The error ""No apps match your search."" is what Windows 8 gives you when you click the Start button and type ""device manager"". The new Start menu is absolutely ugly and difficult to navigate when compared to the previous Windows Start menu. This remains an unacceptable mistake. When Microsoft patches Windows 8 to solve problems like this I will update this review.

Update 12/20/12: Windows 8 still has not been fixed and remains one of the worst operating systems I have ever used. I just tried to download and open a "".doc"" file from my email--an experience so frustrating I had to come here to write this update. Windows 8 does not recognize Microsoft's very own doc format and is asking me to ""Look for an app in the Store"" in order to open a "".doc"" file! This is absolutely insane. Clicking that link goes to a page that suggests 15 possible apps I can download or purchase to open the "".doc"" file, and Microsoft Office isn't even on the list!

"I have been an avid quicken user for over a decade. With each new upgrade, there are always some growing pains and a learning curve. But, with this newest edition and the mobile app, even after owning the product for 2 months I am still having issues with the desktop version. And the mobile app is useless. The main problem I am having with the desktop version is it's failure to download transactions from my bank. I have several accounts at one bank, and the program fails to communicate with this bank to download transactions. One day it will be working just fine, and the next, the program thinks that this account isn't at the bank and suggests I remove it from one-step update. I have deactivated and reactivated one-step update so many times, it is almost comical.

Now for the mobile app. Useless. Waste of disk space. The mobile app doesn't do anything I need it to do. First of all it gives only gives you your online balance (which I can get more quickly from my own bank's app) or your ending balance. Not what your balance is today. (For example, I enter all my bills into my register at the beginning of the month, dated to the day they actually get paid, so they are technically, ""pending"" transactions. This way, I can see if I am going to run out of cash before the next pay day.) The mobile app doesn't give you your balance on any given day, and it doesn't give you your daily balance like it does on the desktop version. The other issue, is it's failure to allow you to edit a split transaction if it was entered on the desktop. You can't transfer money between accounts on the mobile version. If you enter a transaction in the mobile app, the desktop version treats it as a downloaded transaction from a bank. Then, when you try to reconcile, you have to unclear the transaction in order for it to balance.

Then I installed the software and began to restore/convert my company file from 2006 to the newly installed 2012. It simply didn't work. I followed the instructions in the help page, tried several different methods (Restore backup file, open portable company file, and open company file directly). It simply didn't work and kept showing me error code (-1,0). The support guy from Intuit helped me two days and we spent hours and still both he and I were clueless. It has wasted me so much time. This is a poorly poorly built software. If upgrading from an old version to a new version becomes this difficult, the developers of this software should be blamed and ashamed of themselves (I am a developer myself)!!! Unfortunately because my company file is in Premier 2006 we cannot switch to a new software easily. If there is an alternative solution/software, I will abandon QuickBooks immediately.

"This is just a review of Word, as I don't extensively use Excel or the others. I do know from past experience though that it's unlikely that Excel has gotten any smarter.

Microsoft... where to begin? It's old news by now, but I still believe The Ribbon is a crime against humanity. It's one thing to change the user interface, but to do it in a way whose logic is indecipherable is... is stupid. Further amping up the stupid quotient is that much of ""the plumbing"" (the dialog boxes, the way you have to dig through several boxes to do anything, even the appearance, etc.) underneath the ribbon is from the same old Word whose functionality probably peaked with Word 2000 (I'm a long-time Word user since its DOS days).

Anyway, I reluctantly bought Office 2016 hoping that the bugfest that was Office 2010 had been fumigated. Well, so far, I've discovered that Microsoft has traded one set of bugs for another. One noticeable bug is that paragraph styles come and go, depending on Word's moods. They got rid of useful stuff like Picture Manager (which I had to reinstall from Office 2010) and modified AutoCorrect so it's slightly less useful. Typical. One bug of Word 2010 was that it hated keyboard shortcuts, which seems to have been fixed in 2016, but it's early.

In sum, if you're using an older version like 2010 or, even better, Word 2000, there is absolutely no reason to upgrade. Microsoft merely made it ""better"" looking (debatable) but no more useful and arguably less productive (especially when you have to go searching for a function). Since they imposed the ribbon it's become far less customizable than 2000/2003.

Update, February 2016. Been using more extensively and I want to pound my head against the wall. It would be less painful. Had to almost completely rebuild AutoCorrect after Word had a brain-fart. Serious question: Do Microsoft secretaries type on IBM Selectrics? 'Cause that would be more productive. Open a document and Word is NOT smart enough to display all of the existing styles in the Ribbon; you have to modify it yourself.

"I was very skeptical of this product based on past upgrade experience and current online reviews.  I have been a long time Quicken user with my previous version being Quicken 2013.  When R4 of Quicken 2016 was released, the reviews started offering some encouragement so I decided to try it.  My installation and upgrade experience was completely trouble free.  Everything worked just as you would expect it to.  The product installed, it converted my old file to the new format, and prompted to install the R4 patch when completed.  My data all converted cleanly.  All accounts were as they should be with no lost accounts or data.  I was very pleased.  I decided to keep going and try the Quicken Cloud features so that I could access my information with my smart phone.  That didn't go so well.  I activated everything and had to reset passwords.  I could never get beyond the password.  Even after repeated resets, logging on via my web browser with the new password, I could never get to the sync process or access my data from my phone. That's why it's a 4 star review and not a 5 star.  The features available via the smart phone would not be all that useful to me, even If I could get to them. I would really like to be able to enter credit card transactions on my phone and have them automatically sync with my Quicken database.  That capability does not appear to be available.  Nor are all accounts available.  So, I will pass on Quicken's cloud service and continue to use Personal Capital to view my accounts via my smart phone.

I have not found any significant new functionality in Quicken 2016 compared to Quicken 2013.  There ara a couple of minor cosmetic changes, but nothing that would drive me to an upgrade.  My only reason for upgrading was to keep the transaction download and online account reconciliation capabilities from going away.  I think this is close to extortion, but that's just my opinion.  Quicken is such a good and comprehensive personal financial management tool that it's hard to come up with meaningful improvements that would justify an upgrade.  When it does everything that you need it to do, and does it well, why would you need to upgrade?  Intuit's answer is to remove some of what it does unless you upgrade.

"I gave this software to my son who frequently creates video for youtube and twitch.  Here are his thoughts:

This review is based on approximately 4 hours of usage, and may be updated pending further research. The computer was running the latest version of Windows 10.

The software is very similar to Adobe Premiere Pro, so if you're familiar with that program, then the features of this one will come readily.

Some of the nice features of this program include drag and drop inclusion of media, a media library, and easy marking on videos.

But the problem is, the sound and video always de-sync, even before the video fully processes. I tried opening the test file multiple times and processing the video, and each time the audio was off sync with the video.

After getting thru the 2nd disk - I'm very unhappy with the number of errors as other reviewers here have reported.  I've reported these and Fluenz really should correct these ASAP.

My husband and I have tried to learn Spanish a number of times over the years.  We'd start out in a class and end up dropping it partially through the course.  We've both stuck with the Fluenz system and learned more in the first few lessons than years of attempting to learn using other methods.
I find the Fluenz method/program actually FUN and look forward to each session.  I like to do one a day although they recommend twice a week.  (I go back and review lessons too.)

"The one thing you should remember is if you are tempted to buy this program, gnaw off your own arms so you can't. I have a history of using Ghost to image a PC so I can mess around and reimage back to where I was before. it's always been clunky but reliable.

When I needed to do the same at home with an HP 2140 netbook I bought a copy of Ghost (now Symantec) 15.0 to do those images. The first thing I did is plug in the external CD that comes with the 2140. It wouldn't read the Norton CD. My MacBook Air could read it and so could my Windows 7 partition of my iMac. So I copied all the files off onto the Windows 7 desktop and burned a new CD. I then took that CD to my 2140 and that successfully read in. Clearly this wasn't setting me up to succeed so far.

I installed the program onto the computer and looked for the disk image capability. It didn't exist, at least not under that name. There was a lot of backup capability I didn't care about but ok, maybe backing up was what I wanted. So I put a dual layered DVD in the external drive and selected one time backup standard compression verify.

It couldn't get 12GB onto an 8.5GB disk and made me use two disks. After a colossal amount of disk swapping, it died with a cryptic error. So I tried it without verification with maximum compression and at least it didn't need another disk. But it died with the same cryptic error. No copy. No visible files on the disk, but something was there by the capacity.

I tried going online to ask for help. I couldn't email, it forced me onto a chat. There was no selection for ghost so I picked the anti-virus section. I waited about 20 minutes for the chat window to go live (admittedly this was 8 in the morning). Finally someone came on and I told the story. He said oh this is the wrong forum. I went off and did 30 minutes of exercise and still the ""transfer"" to the right group had not yet happened. 30 more minutes I'd done my financial bill paying for the week and still nothing.

"I have been using Quicken for many years and upgrade every year. I am a heavy user of Quicken for my investment portfolios and planning purposes.

I had a flawless conversion of data and I love the planning and budgeting software.  It is simply the best budgeting software yet.  Budgeting has now become more functional and easy to use.

"I've used this program now for about a year and a half.  I'm a computer guy too lazy to write my own version to manage my wife's ever growing collectible and art inventory.  Why write a database when there's a canned version that does what I want, right?  Well, this software does what I want, just not the way I'd prefer to do it...lol.  It's more feature packed than I ever expected, and then some, most especially when it comes to reporting and catalog presentations, but it's NOT for novice computer software users who just jump in and think it should work their way.  This means you actually have to understand a bit about how databases work and their structures before diving in because you can't just copy and paste over their pre-packaged startup structure, even though about 90 percent of the people reviewing here did just that, got into trouble and consequently blamed the software (which I suppose is technically at fault despite their failed efforts).  Also, the program itself is not for the simple user who wants some row and column formatted list of their junk.  They're better suited using a spreadsheet for that because this program is designed for complicated and detailed individualized item inventories (think museum curating and institutional level detailing, file attachments and photography).  This program contains VERY complex data structures, so it's not going to be intuitive, especially to those who have difficulty with English language, as in reading it.  One must READ, infer and test, READ, infer and test, FROM THE BUILT IN HELP INDEX, all in order to make this software work for any real application needs, because there is ABSOLUTELY NO technical support available from the developing company.  If I could offer any ONE THING I LEARNED THE HARD WAY in using this program, it would be that sometimes the pointers in your database will get corrupted, rendering your file absolutely unusable.  Sometimes it can happen when you do a backup, others while you're doing entry.  There's no reasoning to it which would indicate why it happens(ed), BUT THAT DOESN""T MAKE THE SOFTWARE USELESS OR UNRELIABLE.  To make this program work consistently and with total data integrity, YOU SIMPLY MUST MAINTAIN MULTIPLE COPIES OF YOUR DATABASE file in different locations on your backup drive(s)...think: the more backups the merrier.  You will NEVER LOSE anything vital if you do this.  If not, you'll eventually lose all of your work, without a sound file as a restore source.  This is because this program defaults to 5 unique backups, appending the date to each of them when they're done, either automatically or manually on demand of the user.  Periodically, it will do a background copy while you're working, and again when you exit and/or enter the software (I find a backup on entry a little strange).  Anyway, do the arithmetic for yourself and you'll see those 5 backups easily become 3 corrupted ones or even all 5, if the software goes buggy in the background.  You can set extra the program to do extra backups but it ignores this in my experience, so good luck with that.  If you do the multiple location backups I'm suggesting, restoring those hundreds of hours of work (one guy here claimed he lost that much data....geez what a goofball) would have been as easy as clicking on the RESTORE button and choosing your date.  All in all, this software can be a little buggy but there is simply NO better, full featured, turnkey home inventory program out there without writing your own in SQL or some dead or obscure software like Paradox, Dbase or Access.  I know this because not only am I a computer guy but I've spent years looking for one to manage our little home museum of junk nobody really needs.  This program's simple enough though and if you're willing to invest a few hours LEARNING how to use it right, you won't be disappointed.  Patience is the key.

"Norton Security Deluxe is the next generation of last year's Norton Security. This package is for 3 devices and at the time of this review is almost twice as much as getting it for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Norton-Security-Deluxe-for-5-devices/dp/B015724OVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Norton Security Deluxe for 5 devices</a>!! Go figure. Lesson: It pays to shop carefully for Norton products because often ""more is less"".

The biggest changes I see in this product from last year's Norton product is the branding on the box. To be sure there are incremental improvements. Norton Security Deluxe is like the older Norton Security without  Backup for 5 devices. I think this isn't too bad. I like my security software to evolve and improve more than radically change.

Norton Security Deluxe comes with licensing for 3 devices: Windows, Mac, IOS (iPhone/iPad) and Android. This should be enough for many families but maybe not all. You do not get the same features on all devices. I have Windows and IOS so I'll share my experience with these.

Buying a new subscription is less expensive than renewing an existing one. This is a long pattern with Norton products and buying new can save quite a bit.

Windows Setup:

**NOTE** If you have Norton Security (with or without backup) installed and you get this new subscription you will need to remove your device from the Norton control panel. In theory this will uninstall the older product from your computer (but not remove the IOS app for iPhone/iPad devices). In my case I had to manually uninstall Norton Security and reboot my computer before I could install the new subscription.

Installation is pushed out of the Norton account control panel. AFTER I removed old versions I was able to install Norton Security Deluxe very easily and without problems. I registered the product in my existing Norton account to activate 5 devices I could install. The download went smoothly and installation on my Windows 7 desktop was faster than with older CD based Norton products and similar to Norton Security. I did have to restart my computer.

I found it interesting that the installation branding and the control panel branding is still Norton Security reinforcing my perception of a simple evolution and mostly branding changes.

The controls in the GUI are simple and clear coming from Norton Security.  There are lots of on/off controls to customize how Norton works. There is a small gear icon for settings on the main screen of the GUI and many controls are hidden in there.

In operation on Windows I feel Norton Security is continues to be ""noisy"" than pre-2015 versions; I don't feel like I'm constantly being marketed to death. It has the same light impact on PC performance as the previous version.  This is a very good thing! The initial full scan came up clean which is no surprise ince I had last year's version installed before this one.

Application Compatibility Problems:

Unlike last year's version I have had no application compatibility problems. Last year's version has issues with VirtualBox. Good news!

Mobile Support:

The IOS app is better than before, but not all that much. It has anti-theft features. It does not include any virus protection. The Anti-Theft features include:
1) locate your phone: this placed my iPhone 6 a quarter mile away!! Also letting it run GPS in the background significantly reduced my battery life.
2) it can ring your phone: I can just dial the number. If the phone is locked it can't be answered...
3) it has a ""scream"" function: makes your iPhone put out an annoying siren like noise

If the ""scream"" actually sounded like a scream this app would at least have some entertainment value. If you have more devices than the 5 allowed in this product, don't waste one on an IOS device! The IOS does not do much for me and the GPS locator drained my battery. I have read that Android devices have better support against malware. I don't have an android device to try this out.

Conclusions:

This incarnation of Symantec's Norton line of retail/home security products is pretty good. It finds things other anti-virus software misses. It does not seem to slow things down noticeably. With this version I had no application problems which is an improvement. Mobile support for iPhone/iPad is poor. The user interface is simple and there are advanced controls available if you need them.

If you have last years (or older versions) of Norton installed, be sure to remove it from the Norton control panel and device before installing the new version. I could not find a way to move a device from an old subscription to a new one unless I renewed through the Norton site at a higher price. That's annoying.

Because it's a great product for home users, having to reinstall if you buy a new subscription (vs renewing) and the IOS app remains quite limited I'm giving Norton Security Deluxe 4 stars. It a good product with a few gotchas.","Evolution From Last Year's Norton Security: Rebranded, CATCHES Malware Well, Cheaper Than Renewing, 5 User Ver.

Microsoft has finally created an operating system with so much built-in support and maintenance technology it practically does all the work for you, so if your current Windows XP machine is labeled ""Windows Vista Capable"" or ""Windows 7 Capable,"" this is the way to go. Just to be sure, install and run Microsoft's Upgrade Advisor.  If it passes the 64-bit system requirements, order up!

You can't upgrade from XP to 7; you have to wipe the drive or partition and perform a clean install, but even an upgrade from Vista to 7 is fraught with peril, so you might as well do the same if you're running Vista. Just back up your data and find all your application installation software before you begin. Once you activate Windows 7, it's married to the PC's system board. You can't reuse the product key on another machine unless you can convince Microsoft that the previous PC is out of commission. You're also not eligible for free phone and chat support from Microsoft, but there's a big enough expert user base that you should be able to solve most problems by joining a few Windows 7 users' forums.

"I have found some of the negative reviews offensive, as I consider this an exceptional package that gives you an advanced CRM system with facilities and possibilities that are mindbugling.

It offers email marketing possibilities that no email marketing application can properly compete with. It has exceptional email integration and you don't even have to worry about viruses.

I have been using a number of different CRM solutions, and though Goldmine is not perfect, it is superb in the things that you can ask the software to do for you. I have lately had the displeasure to work with the touted salesforce.com, and in that comparison Goldmine is sublime.

The interface is not terribly user friendly but if you use the system capabilities I have never come across a system that offered more value for money.

There are two areas that I don't like about the application;

1. I deal with companies moreso than with individuals, and if you use the ability to use secondary contacts and define the account at the highest level you loose the part about the application that is truely exceptional - the automated tracks that run on primary contacts only.

2. If you have a call list that you need to go through it is inferiour to ACT2000 that i used before. Going through a call list takes longer, and this will only be fixed by expensive add ons.

Great value for money, especially if you have several sales people. Used right this offers something that I have not seen in other applications, though the two points i mentioned reduces the value.

"I don't know why so many negative reviews are being written for this version of the software.

I have been a user since version 9.0 and never ran into any of the difficulities stated in these reviews.  The upgrade to 10.1 which enabled 64 bit funcitonally was clearly communicated to me by e-mail & when I went to the web site.  I received a response within 24 hours from Nuance's general manager when asking about the ability to transfer my license when selling old copies on e-Bay (FYI Nuance does not allow you to transfer your license to another user & I canceled the auctions).  In fact, I've had quite the opposite experience where the Nuance's registration site forgets that I registered my prodcut.  While baffeling, this fact does not diminish my experence with the software.  I have reinstalled (2-3 times) on computers for most of the reasons listed in other reviews and never ""ran out"" of installations.

I still don't like the fit of the headset shipped with the product (why I rated 4 out of 5 stars).  I do need to stress that better ""quality"" microphones exist from other vendors (e.g. Andrea Electronics) that do positively impact the performance of the software.  My specific example is the ""bluetooth"" headset.  I was using a BlueAnt Z9 & purchased an Andrea Electronics BT-200 (highest rated at the time for the bluetooth interface).  This decision made a world of difference regarding performance.  To clarify, the sound input going into the program with the Z9 was not great, so I could not expcet a quality output.  I've since purchased & used the Andrea SuperBeam Array microphone & Plantroics ""plug-in"" USB headset.  All of which made a difference because the sound quality going into the program was improve resulting in a better, faster recongition output.

The major reasons I purchased the version 10 Professional were for the ability to save .dra files (to edit the dicataion at a later time) & the ability to use/program macros.  I consistently use a Sony ICD-MX20 voice recorder (highest rated on Nuance's site when purchased 1-2 years ago) to capture thoughts, take advanage of 10-15 minute delays in the day (e.g between meetings) & to dictate meeting minutes or next actions while there still fresh in my mind, so I can easily retrieve later in the day/week.  I've set up basic macros (in my opinion) and have been pleased with the increase in effeciency.

The recognition accuraccy has improved over time (a bit more than a year now with version 10), especially compared over all the different input sources I use.  The output dicataion is rarely 100% perfect.  However, I can effectively multitask & achieve more in my opinion.

"First of all, I'm an ex-MS Money user, so a bit part of my review would be focused on comparison with MS Money. I've used MS Money for 5+ years and since MS Money was discontinued by Microsoft (i.e. can no longer use online services, which I rely on to download statements from my bank/credit card/brokerage), so I had to switch to quicken.

1. Importing my MS Money file:
Mostly uneventful here, almost all my transactions and accounts were migrated without major issues. It also generates a report showing you some errors and warnings that happened during the conversion. There were still some accounts whose balances were not right so I had to review them manually myself and fix those. One minor annoyance is the character limit on the account name was quite small, but even if the character limit is longer it won't display well on the account list, which truncates long account names.
2. Investment/Brokerage account:
In quicken you can choose to have the cash balance of your investment/brokerage account tracked in a separate account or not. Naturally I chose to have the cash balance in the same account because most of the time the cash balance is 0 for my accounts. The problem is, you can only do that for your brokerage account. If you have a 401(k) account, you don't get to choose! After converting my MS money save file quicken created a separate cash account for my 401k and there's no easy way to combine the cash account and the 401k account! The only way to fix this is to manually go through all the transactions and edit them (and for that particular account, I have 4 year's worth of data). Some of these restrictions seem arbitrary, if I can combine the cash & investment account for normal brokerage accounts, why not 401k accounts?
3. Setting up online downloads
Being able to download transaction history into my financial management software is really important for me. I guess I got used to it in MS Money and can't live without it now. In MS money I opening up the settings of the account, select the financial institution, type in userid and password, then MS money will start downloading for me. In Quicken, not so easy. First, download the web connect file, import into quicken, then select the accounts to apply the imported transactions to, then open up the account options, click improve connection, type in userid and password. If that sounds tedious, it is. (and it doesn't work for all my financial institutions, I think it's fewer than what MS money supports, at least for my case). Oh, and if you want Quicken to remember passwords for you, you need to set up the password vault which has a separate password! I already set up a password for my quicken profile, why do I need to set up a separate password for the password vault?!! Alright, let's say you've set up all the online services correctly, then you hit download (update), the window stays in the foreground while you download. If it takes a second I don't mind, but it usually takes longer than that, and if you financial institution needs answers to secret questions to log you in, then you have to enter that every time! for each account!!! In addition, some accounts that I have set up successfully fail to update afterwards, it'd say that my password is wrong, I checked with my financial institution and they say it's not their problem so I'm not sure what's wrong here.
4. Performance
I have no idea what complex, CPU/IO intensive computations quicken need to perform, but it seems that any operation I need to do, the screen flashes, the disk spins before the operation is performed. If I need to update more than 10 rows of transactions at once, e.g. to change the category, the screen flashes a few times, and it takes one or two seconds for it to complete. Reconciling downloaded transactions? screen flashes a few times again before completion. The worst is when you need to initiate the online update, even bringing up the dialog takes seconds.
5. UI
Simply said, the UI sucks. Unless you look at the report charts all the time, most the of time you're looking at a yellowish background with yellowish panels. There're some rounded corners in the controls, but some still look like they're from the Win98 era. A lot of it is not customizable either, e.g. you can show the account list widget in the ""home"" page and it spans the width of the screen, if you add some other widget onto the ""home"" page, it may split the screen into 2 columns and display them side-by-side or it may display it below the account list widget, but you have no control over that.
6. Other stupidities that I can think of
a/ net worth calculation don't take into account your hidden accounts (closed accounts in MS Money), since I did a refinance on my mortgage last year and thus hid the old mortgage account, my net worth last year it significantly higher than my net worth this year
b/ For any transaction history of any account, you can filter the transactions base on dates and whether the transaction is reconciled or not, e.g. you can view only the uncleared transactions in the current quarter. The problem is, the ""ending balance"" at the bottom of the transaction list only reflects what's shown in the account list! If you want to see the real balance of the account, you either have to show ALL of your transaction history, of switch to the account overview.
c/ You can't edit the ""memo"" field if you're using a one-line register option, so if you regularly use the memo field, stick with the 2-line register display.
d/ Quicken remembers your commonly used payee and offers auto-completion when you enter new transactions, the problem? if you pick one of the old payees, all the information associated with the last transaction to that payee will get copied into your new transaction and you need to edit them all (if you use the one-line register then you won't have the option to edit the memo field). MS Money is smarter in this regard, it only copies the category from the last transaction to the payee.

I'm already addicted to having a personal finance management software on my desktop so having a mediocre software is still better than having none (and I don't trust stuff that store your info online either). So I just have to live with quicken. Arguably Quicken has more functionality than MS money, but the poor UI and unintuitive controls greatly diminished the potential of the software.",Mediocre software with unintuitive UI,True,1260403200,2.4849066497880004,0.0

Then the descriptions in the interview mode appear to have little or no resemblance to what is shown on the IRS form.

"I purchased this software based on the box description, which listed 1)several activities and skills, 2) the words ""Award Winning"" (I should have known - there was an "" * "" after those words, but it related to no explanation), 3) the age for play as 3-5 years,  and 4) the Sesame Street label. Unfortunately, this software wasn't worth purchasing. It's VERY basic and boring. Kids can learn a lot while playing quality computer games which provide fun, some challenges and choices, and creativity along with learning. This game is unable to do that.

I was able to download it on our Mac OSX 10.4.11.  Some Mac users have had issues with installation so if you have a Mac, be aware of that snafu.

The game consists of 5 areas of play: Letters, Numbers, Creativity, Classifying, and People. The problem with the game is that all of it's activities are boring and  not creative, and the instructions are too long, repetitive, and fingernails-on-the-chalkboard annoying to any adult within earshot.

Examples:
For the counting, the game shows the numbers 1-10 with some of the numbers missing. After a long explanation of how to play, the child is to select a misplaced number to put in the correct spot. After doing this, the only thing to happen is the [screechy] muppet slowly counts out the numbers 1-10. What's fun about that? Nothing. Each game has instructions given by a Muppet. The instructions are tedious and lengthy, and repeated over and over for each game played.

The art & creativity area is very basic. Shapes or pictures can be ""clicked"" onto the art board, but nothing much other than that.

The ""People and Places"" section consists of a few videos showing various neighborhood people. Each video is very, very short and Bob sings ""The People in Your Neighborhood"" along with each video.

Game navigation is very poor. There's no way to speed up or skip instructions, or to move quickly between the different games on each level. There's lot of chatting between Muppet characters that doesn't add to the game, and you can't navigate out of. This slows the game down considerably.

The age of game play of 3-5 years is too old. The games are basic that they would appeal to only the very youngest of users and the long verbal explanations for each game would be of interest to, again, only very young users. I would say that 3 years old is probably the max age for full enjoyment of this game.",Very basic; not fun,False,1234915200,1.3862943611198906,0.0

"Purchased Dell XPS 15 with touch screen running windows 8.1 and wasn't sure which Antivirus software suit to install this time.

I checked several of the Antivirus Testing Labs ( AV Test to name one ).

Windows Defender was rated worst ( see bottom of this comment for details ).

Bitdefender & Kaspersky were rated as one of the best in all categories ( Protection, Performance, Usability ).

I really wanted to go with Kaspersky because one year free subscription came with XPS 15 purchase.

I read a lot of reviews and there seems to be a love hate relationship with all Antivirus Suites.

After much deliberation I decided to stick with Norton Internet Security 2014 ( NIS ), since historically, it's seems to have always worked and I NEVER had any viruses or malware to best of my knowledge on any of our systems at home or work.

In past NIS used to be very bloated and consumed lots of system resources. Symantec seems to have enhanced and improved NIS quite a bit in past couple of years. It's lot less bloated and uses lot less system resources.

Again, I really wanted to install and use Kaspersky; however, I've ready too many reviews and heard to many conflicting experiences. Some swear by it, others swear because of it.

"In many ways FileCenter is exactly what I have been looking for for more than a decade as a paperless solution for my home office. I had been using Neat Receipts (now just Neat) for about five years. I never loved it, and over time grew to hate it, as just one individual's records quickly put the hurt on the capabilities of its proprietary database storage format. Four gigabytes for barely a thousand pages of documents? It was slow and cumbersome to use, crashed a lot, and I saw little value in the non-standard bubbly user interface. All I really wanted, for the most part, was to turn my paper into PDFs. Every time the a new version of the software was released, a lengthy database update had to be done, and I was always waiting for something to go wrong and corrupt everything. (There are plenty of stories of this happening to people; I was lucky).

This year I finally hit the wall with it, and looked for a better solution, and stumbled across FileCenter.

FileCenter Pro is lightweight, fast, and doesn't use a proprietary database. Your files just sit in the Windows filesystem, which is fantastic in so many ways. It is probably just as fast if you have a dozen files or 100,000, since it doesn't use a bloated database. You can use any software you already own, and are familiar with, for backing up, viewing, and working with the files. You can index and manage any kinds of files. You can rearrange things with the familiar Windows explorer, and so on.

FileCenter is at its core an Explorer-like UI that integrates a number of tools. It uses PDF X-Change for viewing, editing and indexing PDFs, and the OS built-in Windows Search index for indexing, though you can optionally use dtSearch instead, again included. It has a great many tools for creating profiles that are handy for speeding up the laborious process of turning paper into PDFs: profiles for scanning and optical character recognition, templates for file naming, layouts of the directory structure, organizational helpers. And it worked fine with my Neat scanner.

There is a downside to this simplicity, though. Because there's no database, there's no metadata. One thing which the Neat software did well was to parse information out of the OCR'd data of your scans, and prepopulate metadata about your documents: e.g. receipt $ amount, dates, and so on. FileCenter doesn't do any of these things. It's much more like Google - just scans, OCRs, and indexes. So if you are accustomed to using something like Neat that will let you track metadata and create reports (like summaries of receipt amounts by category), you can't do that.

You can store some data using ""PDF Keywords', a feature of the PDF file format, though it's not especially convenient. To access them, you need to manually open properties for the PDF after it's scanned by selecting it and typing CTRL+D, and then enter data in an open-text field.  After some experimentation I found I could create key/value pairs in the PDF keywords, for example:

  ""category=insurance; type=receipt; amount=1500.00""

Searching on ""category/insurance"" will find everything that has that key/value pair. So this is some help, but it would be nice if the UI had some tooling to help populate this data, like letting you set up pre-defined labels to use, and some form that would let you easily fill them out each time you scanned a document. Even better, how about a little intelligence to parse out dates and dollar amounts like Neat does. I don't think this would be very hard since the documents are already OCR'd, it would be pretty easy to recognize common date and dollar value formats.

Once that data is in there, it's fine for searching for things, but you are still on your own for aggregating dollar amounts. Since I happen to be a computer programmer, I'll probably just write some basic program to do this to suit my needs, but again this is something that would be of immense value to include with the package, and wouldn't be especially difficult to implement.

At the end of the day, while I wish it offered a few value-added features as I've described, since it doesn't use any kind of proprietary system for managing your files, it leaves you free to solve those problems using other tools, unlike all-in-one packages such as Neat which lock you in completely. This is far more important to me than having to possibly add up some receipts by hand once a year (until I write that app to parse out my PDF tags :). I hope Lucion considers enhancing their software in this way which would make it more directly competitive with some of the more mainstream consumer-facing products which, although feature laden, are invariably awful to use in practice.

Summary: It keeps your data where it belongs, in your file system, and provides some great features for scanning, managing, and organizing a large amount of electronic data. It lacks features for creating metadata, but there are workarounds. Perhaps this might be a future enhancement idea for Lucion. I could also imagine some other app easily filling that gap, which is a good thing: since everything is just files, you have no limits on what else you can use to manage them. I expect this software will have a lot of longevity, unlike Neat, it should be difficult to outgrow.

"Quick review - Before you try this product, you can try the free 30 day trial from the ESET website or even from Amazon itself. I have been using since ESET 2013.

I put it on maximum settings on a system with - win 7 - 64 bit, 4GB Ram, 2.x Ghz, 300 GB 7,200 rpm hdd. I have had no performance issues. The customer support is good and prompt. ESET was blocking some important work related software and the customer support helped me to fix the problem. But it took a bit of trial and error though.

The main reason why I am malware free for 1+ year might be because of I surf safe websites, do not use any other people's thumb drives, use script blockers for Firefox (no script) and Google (ghostery) and above all, run browsers inside a sandbox when surfing potentially dangerous websites.

"BEWARE!  Does not include State returns, after buying this product this morning I found out that for the first time that I can remember Intuit actually shipped a ""TurboTax Deluxe"" product that does NOT include State Taxes.  And when I use the program to try to buy State Tax filing for California, they want an additional $39.99 on top of the $39.48 I had already paid for TurboTax to begin with.  Would have NEVER bought this edition if it had said in the title line that THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE STATE.

Had I bought the $43.82 TurboTax Deluxe 2015 Federal + State Taxes + Fed EFile Tax Preparation Software, I'd have everything I need.  Intuit should NOT offer a slightly (by $3.83) cheaper edition and deceptively ask an additional $40 when you realize you forgot to get TurboTax State.

(Also FYI, MOST people live in states  (43 out of 50) with an income tax of some kind, it's disingenuous to say, ""Well, this is the edition for those with no state tax"".  Some TPM at Intuit needs to be canned for this.)

As digital software downloads on Amazon.com are NOT returnable, now I'm out the money on this purchase as it's not going to get the job done.
I have to go back and buy TurboTax all over again with the State edition, as it comes out to be about the same price anyway.  But this time I'm going to get the physical product, as apparently I can't trust Intuit with digital downloads of their products any longer.

I've been using TurboTax for my income tax filing for 20 years now, VERY disappointed that they've pulled such a bait-and-switch.
Will be exploring alternate products that don't stick in hidden fees, I thought Intuit was better than this.","Do NOT buy this edition, does NOT include State, which will cost as much as this product alone!  STAY AWAY!",True,1455580800,1.9459101490553128,0.0

"I purchased the Intego Mac Premium Bundle a year ago, and they intentionally stopped it from working exactly 12 months later. I'd paid $45 for the software bundle, but 12 months later, Intego blocked its functionality and started claiming that it was a SUBSCRIPTION and that I must pay $79.99 for an additional 12 month of software usage. NOWHERE on this product's page, nor on the other bundle's page, does it list it as being a subscription product that would be functional for 12 months before requiring an additional payment (which, for me, was almost TWICE what I'd paid). Of course, this should be clearly identified on the product page, if not in the product's name/title.

Once I discovered this problem, I wrote Intego support, and they didn't relent at all. They claimed that it was common for such software programs to operate this way, though were unable to explain why, if that's the case, they don't clearly advertise and market this product as a 12-month subscription. I wrote back and forth several time and was told by ""Justin Fain, Director of Support Operations"" at Intego that, ""We do not provide open ended subscriptions for Intego software."" However, neither do they state for consumers on their product pages (not anywhere I can see at this writing, anyway) that these are products valid for only a limited duration. To me, this is fraudulent, and at least Amazon eventually gave me a refund for the product (though getting that refund was quite difficult).

"We recently upgraded from the now obsolete and unsupported Peachtree Pro Accounting 2010 to the Sage 50 Complete Accounting 2013.  Our business simply needs bookkeeping vs. full-fledged accounting.  We don't get involved with more advanced features like check-printing or the ""Sage Connected Services"" of card processing, payroll or direct deposit.

The installation process was very simple, and we had no complications at all.  The recommended method to configure Windows Firewall automatically worked well.

I really like the Prior Period Account Reconciliation, so that we can reconcile bank accounts and access past transactions without switching accounting periods.

I also appreciate, as a user of a previous version, that the design of screens is familiar.  The layout remains grouped, e.g. ""Customer & Sales"", ""Vendors & Purchases"", etc.

The software functions similarly to the previous version, so it remains familiar.  This makes the transition much more comfortable.
