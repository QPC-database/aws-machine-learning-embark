## AWS Machine Learning Embark

Born out of thousands of successful customer implementations and Amazon’s own experience scaling the use of machine learning (ML) in the organization, the [AWS Machine Learning Embark](https://aws.amazon.com/ml-embark/) program combines the training, coaching, and implementation support needed to launch your company’s machine learning journey and transform your development teams into machine learning practitioners.

Getting started with machine learning is equal parts technology and culture change. Many organizations struggle with where to even start, because there aren’t well-understood patterns to follow. Projects might struggle to find momentum because they lack a rallying cry to motivate big changes. Once underway, it’s easy to get caught reinventing solutions to well-solved problems and making novice mistakes that slow you down because teams get stuck in silos or don’t have the right technical skills. And, when projects are delivered to production, they may not catalyze change because they weren’t aligned to the right business goals.

The AWS Machine Learning Embark program is designed to start your company on the journey to machine learning success. The content is based on years of proven success helping organizations adopt ML, as well as Amazon’s own journey to put ML first in all areas of our business. The program starts with an interactive workshop to identify the right business problem to tackle, followed by on-site, hands-on training to ramp up your company’s machine learning skills fast through practical application. Your developers then have the opportunity to partner with AWS machine learning experts from the ML Solutions Lab to build at least one proof of concept. The program also includes a corporate AWS DeepRacer event to get your company motivated to embrace machine learning through hands-on friendly competition. With the practical skills, knowledge, and motivation derived from the program, your company will be ready to take your machine learning journey to the next stage.
